### Introduction

The division of Korea in 1945 led to the emergence of two competing states, each defining itself explicitly in opposition to the other. Both Kim Il-sung’s North Korea and Syngman Rhee’s South Korea strategically employed literature, cinema, and broader cultural media as instruments for ideological reinforcement and the formation of distinct national identities. This paper investigates how these regimes utilized cultural production, specifically examining media policy, historical narrative and mythmaking, personality cults versus institutional imagery, and thematic content in literature and cinema.

Following Benedict Anderson’s concept of “imagined communities,” we argue that media served not only as a tool for nation-building but also as a battlefield where competing ideologies vied to construct collective memory and legitimacy (Anderson 6). North Korea's embrace of Juche ideology and socialist realism stood in sharp contrast to South Korea's pro-Western capitalist democracy, creating diametrically opposed narratives about what constituted authentic Korean identity. Furthermore, both regimes meticulously employed historical symbolism and ritual to anchor their respective ideological narratives deeply into collective national consciousness. Recent scholarship highlights how South Korea strategically employed anti-Japanism as an ideological necessity for constructing a homogenous national identity distinct from colonial influences, further differentiating itself from North Korea (Kang 1-2)

### Ideological Foundations and Media Policy

The media policies of North and South Korea reflect their broader ideological frameworks. Deeply shaped by U.S. geopolitical interests, Rhee’s South Korea employed anti-communism as a foundational state-building strategy, particularly through the 1948 National Security Act. This Act enforced stringent censorship to eliminate communist or leftist expressions, framing communism as existentially opposed to national security and identity (Kim 123). Seo (2007) emphasizes that Rhee’s regime did not promote organic nationalism but wielded it as an authoritarian tool, relying on American military and economic backing. Further enriching its ideological foundations, South Korea integrated anti-Japanism into its identity-building project immediately after liberation, linking this stance closely to pro-American and anti-communist sentiments, thus solidifying alignment with Western interests (Kang 2). Additionally, South Korea's long-term strategic promotion of its popular culture  underscores an institutionalized approach to national branding that originated during Rhee’s era as an investment in the nation’s future global image (Kim and Vasileva 9866).

While South Korea imposed stringent censorship on communist materials, it did not fully nationalize its film and publishing industries. The National Security Act criminalized North Korean publications and media exposure, making it illegal to possess North Korean books, newspapers, or even postage stamps featuring Kim Il-sung’s image (Klein 292). Listening to North Korean radio broadcasts was criminalized as leftist subversion, punishable by imprisonment (Anderson 6-7). This strict censorship reinforced Rhee’s broader ideological project: defining South Korean identity in opposition to North Korea while preventing alternative narratives from threatening the legitimacy of the Republic of Korea. 

U.S. influence in South Korean media was deliberate, with organizations like The Asia Foundation funding media initiatives that aligned with pro-democratic and capitalist ideals. These projects ranged from compiling Hangul dictionaries to supporting Korean folk arts, reinforcing national identity independent of Japanese colonial influence and communism (Klein 292).

Yet, as Lee (2011, 38-39) notes, Rhee’s alignment with the United States was not absolute. His anti-communism was not solely a Cold War stance but a deeply personal conviction, rooted in his fears of Soviet imperialism. Rhee viewed Korea’s historical subservience to foreign powers—whether China, Japan, or the Soviet Union—as a cautionary tale, arguing that Korea’s sovereignty could only be secured through a robust anti-communist and pro-market stance (Lee 42-43). His unilateral release of North Korean POWs in 1953, against U.S. wishes, exemplifies his determination to prioritize Korean unification over strict adherence to American policy (Lee 39). This defiant stance suggests that while U.S. influence was undeniable, Rhee’s strategic vision was ultimately driven by a desire to assert South Korea’s agency rather than merely align with Western powers.

By contrast, North Korea built an entirely different media landscape. Under Kim Il-sung, state-controlled media became the vehicle for Juche ideology, emphasizing self-reliance and socialist ideals while rejecting external influences (Armstrong 84). North Korean media adopted Socialist Realism, a Soviet-derived aesthetic mandating that cultural productions portray revolutionary victories and class solidarity (Lee 57). Media became a tightly regulated state apparatus, embedding ideological loyalty and devotion to the Kim family through historical and political education. By university, nearly 40% of North Korean curricula were politically oriented, solidifying state ideology (Grzelczyk 182). Unlike South Korea, where some space remained for commercial cinema and literature within state-controlled limits, North Korean cultural production was entirely nationalized. The Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD) oversaw every aspect of cultural life, ensuring total ideological uniformity and eliminating any potential ideological deviation (Madden 1).

Kim Il-sung’s 1955 speech, *On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work*, marked a decisive break from Soviet ideological models, signaling a turn toward total ideological self-reliance (Album: Revolutionary Activities of Comrade Kim Il Sung). Following this, North Korean media underwent a systematic purge of Soviet and Chinese influences, cementing media as a tool for ideological purity (Anderson 39-40). Kim’s vision emphasized that all cultural expressions—films, literature, music, and even visual art—had to embody the revolutionary spirit, depict proletarian heroism, and reinforce the infallibility of the Great Leader.

This ideological shift further cemented media’s role in shaping Kim Il-sung’s cult of personality. Unlike Rhee, who positioned South Korea’s identity around institutions and anti-communism, North Korean media directly linked national identity to Kim’s leadership. The press, radio, and literature were flooded with stories glorifying Kim’s alleged guerrilla exploits against the Japanese, transforming historical narratives to position him as the central figure in Korea’s revolutionary past and future (Portal 130-131). All foreign influences were banned unless they were carefully curated to support North Korea’s narrative. Whereas South Korea permitted some engagement with Western cultural materials–as long as they aligned with anti-communism–North Korea’s cultural sphere was a closed system, designed to instill absolute loyalty to Kim and the Workers’ Party.

Building upon these ideological foundations, both regimes crafted historical narratives that reinforced their respective national identities. South Korea sought to define itself as the legitimate Korean state upholding democracy and economic modernization, while North Korea built a totalitarian identity centered on socialist nationalism and leader worship. Both nations exercised extreme media control, but with different goals: Rhee’s South Korea suppressed communism while maintaining an anti-communist democratic image, whereas Kim’s North Korea constructed an identity that merged national survival with ideological purity, ensuring that North Koreans saw themselves not just as citizens, but as revolutionary subjects under Kim Il-sung’s leadership.

### Historical Narrative and Mythmaking

Historical narratives were central to legitimizing both regimes. In South Korea, Syngman Rhee's regime meticulously constructed historical narratives that underscored its legitimacy by aligning national identity with anti-communist and democratic ideals. State rituals and commemorations strategically reinforced legitimacy and shaped a national identity distinct from North Korea. The March 1st Movement was presented as the foundation of Korea’s ‘racial independence,’ a historical ‘compass, signal, and milestone’ for the nation’s future (H. Kim 95). Likewise, ‘Gwangbokjeol,’ marking Korea’s liberation and the Republic of Korea’s founding, was framed as a national rebirth, reinforcing South Korea’s narrative of democratic and capitalist progression (H. Kim 95-96).

Rhee’s administration used state rituals to reinforce anti-communism and capitalist democracy, turning memorials into powerful ideological instruments. The Memorial for the Korean War (Yugio Sabyeon Ginyeomil), although officially established in 1973, was implicitly observed during Rhee's tenure as a critical element in reinforcing anti-communist sentiment, portraying North Korea as a constant existential threat (H. Kim 97). Memorials explicitly connected the sacrifices of war dead to anti-communist patriotism, presenting fallen soldiers as guardians of liberty and democracy, pillars upholding the divided nation's ideological stance (H. Kim 98). This symbolic framing elevated war dead to sacred figures, reinforcing institutional legitimacy over personal glorification.

Rhee’s administration reinforced an unbroken lineage from Dangun, the legendary founder of Korea, making ethnic purity and historical continuity central to South Korea’s national identity. Celebrations of "Gaecheonjeol" highlighted narratives of racial purity and historical continuity, suggesting Koreans maintained an unwavering national essence since ancient times (H. Kim 105). This historical narrative selectively justified South Korea’s separation from the communist North by emphasizing traditional nationalism as fundamental to state legitimacy. By depicting Japan as morally corrupt and inferior, South Korean literature reinforced a post-colonial national identity aligned with American geopolitical interests. South Korean literary works explicitly portrayed the Japanese as morally corrupt, filthy, and inferior, starkly contrasting them with an idealized, pure Korean identity (Kang 9-12). This literary deployment of anti-Japanese sentiment reinforced an imagined community sharply distinct from colonial-era identities, forming part of broader efforts to shape a cohesive, post-colonial national consciousness aligned with American geopolitical interests.

Kim Il-sung’s regime rewrote history, portraying him as Korea’s sole liberator while downplaying Soviet contributions and elevating his guerrilla past as the foundation of state legitimacy (Hart 154). North Korean educational materials consistently portrayed Kim as a revolutionary hero whose personal achievements and struggles formed the bedrock of the nation's historical narrative, extending into broader cultural productions and state rituals (Won and Huntington 276). North Korean textbooks framed Kim Il-sung as a self-sacrificing revolutionary, promoting solidarity for reunification under his leadership (Won and Huntington 276). Complementing this, visual portrayals such as kindergarten textbook maps depicted a unified Korea with Pyongyang as its capital, symbolically erasing South Korea's legitimacy (Won and Huntington 281).

#### Cult of Personality vs. Institutional Imagery
A key distinction between North and South Korea’s national identities lies in their portrayal of leadership. Despite its authoritarianism, South Korea’s leadership imagery prioritized institutional legitimacy, linking national identity to democracy and economic modernization rather than to Rhee’s personal glorification (K. Kim 156). Rhee's regime presented modern South Korean society as both ideal and justified, inherently connecting economic and democratic advancements to national identity (Hart 148).

In contrast, North Korea built an extensive personality cult around Kim Il-sung, portraying him as a near-messianic figure essential to the nation's survival (Grzelczyk 182). This narrative framed Kim and his family as indispensable leaders, elevating their historical roles to solidify legitimacy (Hart 154-155). These contrasting leadership depictions were carefully reinforced through state-controlled cinema and literature, shaping public perceptions of legitimacy and national identity.

### Forms of Media, Themes in Cinema and Literature

South Korean cinema frequently highlighted anti-communist themes, celebrating democratic values and capitalist modernity while incorporating Hollywood aesthetics (Yecies 45). Films such as Viva Freedom! (1946) commemorated anti-colonial resistance while reinforcing the state's ideological stance. Later films, such as Joint Security Area (2000), challenged earlier authoritarian narratives, opening pathways for cultural introspection. The South Korean film Piagol (1955) depicted communist guerrillas as violent and morally corrupt, reinforcing anti-communist propaganda. Films aligned with state ideology were labeled "quality films," receiving institutional privileges such as favorable import quotas, regardless of artistic merit (Min 51). This state support linked artistic legitimacy directly to ideological utility rather than commercial success.

Under Syngman Rhee, South Korean cinema became a tool for ideological reinforcement, strategically utilizing historical narratives, modernization themes, and censorship policies to craft a distinct national identity. The Korean film industry was not merely a medium of entertainment but a battlefield of ideological expression, where Hollywood aesthetics counteracted leftist influences and positioned South Korea as a bastion of capitalist democracy. Hollywood’s influence served a dual function: reinforcing South Korea’s alignment with the United States and promoting Western modernity as the desirable pathway for national development. The Rhee government’s tacit endorsement of Hollywood influence ensured that South Korean films emphasized themes of personal ambition, social mobility, and economic success as markers of progress (Korean Film: Hollywood Imagination, 164). However, films such as Madame Freedom (1956) revealed tensions between modernization and traditional Confucian values. The protagonist, a housewife embracing Western fashion and values, ultimately faces societal condemnation, reflecting anxieties about consumerism, shifting gender roles, and individualism.

#### Modernization, Censorship, and Critique of Authoritarianism
Reflecting South Korea’s ideological alignment with capitalist modernization, literature served as a vehicle for both implicit and explicit ideological messaging. Yi Injik’s Silvery World (1908), though predating the Rhee era, established modernization narratives under foreign guidance, a theme later appropriated to justify U.S. influence in South Korea’s post-colonial trajectory (Pettid 24). The novel’s portrayal of Korea as “downtrodden and shoddy” contrasted with an idealized Westernized vision, reinforcing the notion that Korea required external guidance for national renewal (Pettid 29).

South Korean literature also employed historical allegories to subtly critique authoritarianism. Kim Tongni’s The Rock (1936) explored themes of alienation and societal decay under oppressive rule, critiques applicable to both Japanese colonialism and later South Korean regimes (Lee 72). This subtlety allowed authors to express dissent while avoiding direct confrontation with state censors, foreshadowing later cinematic strategies under strict ideological oversight. Cho Sehui’s Knifeblade provides a stark critique of South Korea’s rapid industrialization, highlighting its civil, labor, and environmental abuses (Fulton and Kwon 216). Similarly, Yi Hoch’ol’s Far From Home (1955) and Yi Chongjun’s Footprints in the Snow (1960s) both explore alienation during South Korea’s rapid modernization. Far From Home juxtaposes the protagonist’s longing for rural simplicity with his dehumanizing urban experiences, complicating South Korea’s modernization discourse. Yi Munyol’s The Old Hatter extends this critique, lamenting the erosion of traditional Confucian values, symbolizing cultural dislocation and spiritual loss amid rapid change (Lee 278-280).

#### Juche and Socialist Realism in Literature and Film

North Korea’s cultural production adhered rigidly to Juche ideology and Socialist Realism, reinforcing class struggle and revolutionary ideals. Unlike South Korea, where some media diversity existed within state-controlled frameworks, North Korea’s media was wholly monopolized by the state, ensuring absolute ideological alignment. Media functioned as a direct instrument of the Party, shaping national identity around self-reliance, revolutionary fervor, and devotion to Kim Il-sung.

Early twentieth-century literary figures like Yi Kiyŏng provided ideological foundations for North Korean propaganda. His story Commoners' Village (1925) depicted the exploitation of peasants, a theme later elevated in North Korean revolutionary literature. Yi’s portrayal of capitalist oppression—"The moral corruption of landlords and the helplessness of the poor vividly demonstrate the injustices of class hierarchy" (Pettid 2019, 263)—aligned with North Korea’s class-based resistance narrative. Similarly, Cho Myŏng-hŭi’s Naktong River emphasized proletarian struggle, portraying socialism as a force that inspires youth movements against colonial oppression (Pettid 2019, 249).

Kim Il-sung’s monolithic control over cultural production led to the rigid standardization of cinema, literature, and visual propaganda in the service of leader worship and nationalist ideology. The Propaganda and Agitation Department (PAD) oversaw all cultural works, ensuring they glorified Kim as the nation’s savior and the Party as the sole representative of Korean destiny (Madden 1). Cinema became a key medium for mass indoctrination, reinforcing North Korea’s official narratives through state-funded Socialist Realist films. My Home Village (1949), North Korea’s first feature film, exemplifies how cinema legitimized communist rule. The film follows a poor peasant family suffering under Japanese colonialism and feudal landlords, ultimately finding salvation through North Korean land reform. This narrative framed land redistribution as a moral and political victory, reinforcing Kim Il-sung’s role as the nation’s liberator (Portal 130-131).

Beyond historical validation, North Korean media actively constructed external enemies, particularly the United States and South Korea, to reinforce siege mentality nationalism. Literature such as Han Sŏrya’s Jackals (1951) solidified anti-American sentiment by portraying an American missionary and his family as vicious predators who brutalize a young Korean boy. The story’s dehumanization of Americans as “jackals” became a key rhetorical device in North Korean propaganda, reinforcing the idea that Korean survival required unwavering hostility to U.S. imperialism (Fields). This theme extended to film and visual propaganda, where North Korean soldiers and peasants were depicted as morally superior revolutionaries defending the homeland from external threats.

#### Jackals (1951) | North Korean National Identity Formation
Han Sŏrya’s Jackals (1951) is one of the most infamous examples of North Korean propaganda literature, explicitly designed to construct a national identity rooted in siege mentality, anti-Americanism, and revolutionary struggle. Written during the Korean War, Jackals does not merely reflect the ideological climate of its time—it actively shapes it. The novella paints Americans as sadistic, imperialistic, and inhuman, legitimizing militant nationalism and justifying extreme hostility toward foreign influence. In this way, it serves the same ideological function as cinematic works like My Home Village (1949), reinforcing Juche and Socialist Realist narratives.

The novella follows Sugil, a young Korean boy who is brutally beaten by Simon, the son of an American missionary, for playing with a ball Simon claims as his own. The ball serves as a metaphor for Korea, suggesting that Americans feel entitled to take what is not theirs. Sugil’s suffering continues—his injuries are ignored, and when his mother pleads for justice, she is met with racist condescension. The missionary and his wife embody imperialist hypocrisy, using religion as a mask for their brutality. The wife patronizingly assures Sugil’s mother that “we are all God’s children,” just before orchestrating Sugil’s death at the mission hospital. American doctors claim that Sugil has a contagious disease and cremate his body to erase all evidence of wrongdoing—an act of biopolitical violence mirroring North Korean propaganda narratives of U.S. war crimes during the Korean War.

The novella frames American brutality as systemic and deliberate, reinforcing the idea that Americans cannot be negotiated with—only fought. Jackals functions as explicit justification for militant resistance, reinforcing the belief that only through revolutionary struggle can Koreans reclaim their dignity.
Its symbolism is unsubtle yet effective. Americans are “jackals,” dehumanized predators who seek to exploit and destroy Koreans. Sugil’s innocence, contrasted with Simon’s violent entitlement, reinforces a stark moral binary: Koreans are inherently virtuous, while foreigners are irredeemably evil. Sugil’s death becomes a national martyrdom, a metaphor for Korea’s suffering under imperialism. His mother’s pleas for justice—met with scorn—mirror North Korea’s claims that the U.S. disregards Korean sovereignty and dignity.

Thus, Jackals is not merely a work of literature—it is textbook propaganda, crafted to instill hatred toward Americans, reinforce North Korea’s self-perception as a besieged revolutionary state, and justify militant nationalism.

### Comparative Analysis: Binary Opposition and External Influence

Both Koreas defined themselves through opposition. South Korea framed North Korea as an oppressive communist dictatorship, reinforcing its own identity as a democratic, Western-aligned state (K. Kim 156). Conversely, North Korea portrayed South Korea as an American puppet, emphasizing the South’s subservience to Western imperialism (Grzelczyk 187).

Syngman Rhee’s ideological project was not simply anti-communist but also an assertion of sovereignty against foreign domination (Lee 36). While Kim Il-sung positioned himself as the leader of an anti-imperialist revolution, Rhee framed South Korea as the legitimate successor to Korean independence efforts, rejecting both Soviet-backed communism and any infringement on self-determination (Lee, 38). His insistence that South Korea inherited the Shanghai Provisional Government’s legacy further strengthened this narrative (Lee 36-37). Media played a central role in reinforcing these binary oppositions. South Korean identity was framed around freedom, democracy, and Western alignment, embedding anti-communism into its literature, cinema, and political discourse (Cold War Cosmopolitanism: The Asia Foundation and 1950s Korean Cinema). U.S. cultural influence deeply shaped South Korean national identity, as seen in Madame Freedom (1956), which linked capitalist modernity with South Korean progress. Meanwhile, anti-communist narratives such as Piagol (1955) reinforced the ideological distance between the two Koreas (Kang 2).

North Korea’s identity, by contrast, was structured around self-reliance, anti-imperialism, and devotion to Kim Il-sung. Media depicted the nation as the true guardian of Korean purity, under siege from the U.S. and South Korea (Fields). Films like My Home Village (1949) and Jackals (1951) constructed an image of North Korea as a revolutionary stronghold, defending its people from imperialist oppression. Both regimes criminalized exposure to opposing ideologies. In South Korea, the National Security Act (1948) banned North Korean books, newspapers, and films, extending to the arrest or exile of leftist intellectuals (Anderson 6-7). However, unlike North Korea, South Korea permitted controlled engagement with foreign culture, particularly Hollywood films and American literature, which helped shape its national identity within the “Free World.”

North Korea, on the other hand, completely sealed itself off from foreign influences, allowing only Soviet and Chinese socialist media until Kim Il-sung’s 1955 speech on Juche, which rejected external ideological dependence (Album: Revolutionary Activities of Comrade Kim Il Sung). From then on, all literature, cinema, and music served the cult of Kim Il-sung and ideological purity. Beyond ideology, these binary narratives extended into cultural forms. South Korean media, while strictly censoring leftist materials, still allowed literature and cinema to explore themes of modernization, gender roles, and economic anxieties. By contrast, North Korean media remained rigidly monolithic, entirely focused on revolutionary struggle and glorification of the Great Leader.

Ultimately, media served as a cultural battlefield where each Korea sought to legitimize itself while negating the other. South Korea positioned itself as a beacon of freedom and progress, while North Korea claimed to be the last bastion of Korean purity and self-reliance. These narratives were deeply embedded in the films, books, and propaganda that shaped public consciousness on both sides of the 38th parallel.

### Media as a Cultural Battlefield

Through strategic control and manipulation of media, both Koreas effectively transformed cultural production into a battleground for national identity formation. South Korea framed itself as a beacon of anti-communist democratic capitalism, leveraging modernization, institutional legitimacy, and selective cultural openness to reinforce its ideological position. North Korea, by contrast, constructed an identity rooted in Juche, revolutionary struggle, and a rigid personality cult, ensuring absolute ideological control through Socialist Realist aesthetics and historical revisionism. The media policies of both regimes were not just reactive but proactive–each to legitimize themselves and negate the other, embedding this binary opposition into literature, cinema, and public memory.

These ideological strategies did not exist in isolation. South Korea’s media landscape, though heavily censored, incorporated Western influences and Hollywood aesthetics as tools of soft power, aligning its cultural output with global capitalist modernity. Meanwhile, North Korea systematically purged Soviet and Chinese influences by the mid-1950s, recalibrating its media to embody a self-reliant, hermetically sealed vision of national identity. While in the end of the twentieth century South Korea loosened control, through the ruling Kim family North Korea remains an example of total control, where state narratives dictate not just political allegiance but personal identity. The division of media, once a wartime necessity, has become a self-perpetuating structure, continuously reinforcing the historical and ideological split of the Korean peninsula.

Stepping beyond the historical context, the strategies employed by North and South Korea in the mid-20th century offer a striking lens through which to examine our own informational age. Today, we have access to an unprecedented volume of media, yet the slice of information we engage with is curated–filtered by algorithms, ideological preferences, and digital echo chambers. The tools of ideological reinforcement may have changed, but the fundamental structures remain: the information we consume shapes not only how we understand history but how we define ourselves in the present. In this vast informational landscape, the responsibility falls upon us to question sources, recognize biases, and understand how the narratives we are presented with may subtly reconstruct how we see the world and identify ourselves . If the Korean experience demonstrates anything, it is that media is never neutral; it is a force that not only reflects reality but actively constructs it.
