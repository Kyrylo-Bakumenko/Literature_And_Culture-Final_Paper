Have you been well?\\\" \\nHis wife greeted him with pleasure and took the coat that Chun'gi was re\\u00ad\\nmoving. But he did not look at his wife. As was his habit when coming home, \\nhe first looked down at the little ones, an expression of loving satisfaction on \\nhis face. They were lying side by side at the warm end of the room with their \\nquilts kicked aside and arms spread wide. \\n\\\"How've our little friends been?\\\" He did not wait for the answer. \\\"Ippuni \\nand Koptani seem the same as ever. They may take after their mother with \\nthose funny little noses but one's as sweet and gentle as. the other. Chaeho \\ntakes after his father with his chubby cheeks and stubborn temper. But, look \\nat him! He's all boy, isn't he?\\\" \\nHe gave a big laugh. Then he settled in the warm end of the room with his \\ndaughters and covered them with their quilts. \\nHis wife, Kim-shi, ignored his explosive laughter while she hung up the \\novercoat. But then she turned to her barely graying husband and spoke as if \\nchiding him. \\n\\\"The children will hear you! Have you eaten dinner?\\\" \\n\\\"Oh, do I roar all the time? It's just because I'm thinking of you. Anyway, \\nI ate dinner in the dining car on the train. Where has Chaeshik gone?\\\" \\nChun' gi finally looked at his loyal wife. Her face was lit with a smile of sat\\u00ad\\nisfaction. \\n\\\"He's gone to his study group but he should be back soon.\\\" \\n\\\"Anything happen while I was away? Not even a meeting of the school \\nParents Association?\\\" \\n\\\"Nothing. The children have all been studying well, there has been no \\ntrouble, and the boys' attitude has been so very good! They tell me our fam\\u00ad\\nily should be envied! You must be tired-do sleep now.\\\" THE SON 197 \\nAs Kim-shi was making up the bed, Chaeshik came in, a book-bag slung \\nover his shoulder. The new Youth Corps leadership patch on the left sleeve \\nof his jacket was quite eye-catching. He was in charge of the local Corps bul\\u00ad\\nletin board. Chaeshik saw his father and smiled wide as he removed his fur \\ncap. \\n\\\"Father, you're back!\\\" he said with a bow. \\nChun'gi looked at his son with satisfaction. \\n\\\"Yes. Did you study hard while I was away?\\\" As though the thought sud\\u00ad\\ndenly struck him, he pulled his vinyl travel bag forward and opened it. He \\ntook out a student's notebook and a bag of cookies and candy, which he gave \\nto his son. \\n\\\"Share these with your brother and sisters.\\\" \\nChaeshik, his face wide with generous cheeks, smiled and chuckled as he \\ndrew a sheet of white paper from under his desk. On it he set out some cook\\u00ad\\nies and candy from the bag and placed them in front of Chun'gi. \\n\\\"Mother, please eat some too.\\\" \\n\\\"No, it's just for you children to eat,'' said Chun'gi, impressed by the boy. \\nHe pushed it toward his wife. \\n\\\"Here. Have a taste.\\\" \\nHis wife, who had been watching her son with affection-filled eyes, re\\u00ad\\nsponded. \\\"I'd feel full without even eating,'' she said, picking up one piece of \\nthe candy and putting it in her mouth. She then placed the paper dish of \\ncandy and cookies back in front of her son. \\nQuite satisfied that everything had gone as usual during his absence, just \\nas he had wished, Chun'gi could set aside his anxieties at last and stretch out \\nfor a good night's sleep. \\nThe children, awaking the next morning, clung to their father and relished \\nthe candy and cookies that Chaeshik shared with them. \\nThen Chaeho, who was to enter school in the new year, came in from out\\u00ad\\nside. \\n\\\"Chaeshik! There's been lots of snow! Let's go out and play and clear the \\nsnow in the yard! Huh?\\\" he said, dragging at Chaeshik's arm. Chaeshik \\nscrewed up his face. \\n\\\"I've got things to do. You go out by yourself.\\\" He tried to free his arm, \\nbut the more he pulled, the tighter his younger brother held. \\nMother had folded up the bedding. \\n\\\"Let your brother be. He must do his studying,\\\" she said, taking Chae\\u00ad\\nshik's part. Chaeshik freed his arm from his brother's grasp and hurried to his \\ndesk and opened up a book. \\n\\n----- PAGE 109: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n198 KIM PUKHYANG \\nChun'gi glanced with satisfaction at his eldest son and took Chaeho out\\u00ad\\nside to clear the snow. \\nWhen he went to work that day, Chun'gi reported on his special assign\\u00ad\\nment and was praised for his efforts. With a sense of satisfaction, he threw \\nhimself into clearing away the work that had piled up. Then a phone call \\ncame from the teacher in charge of Chaeshik's class. Chun'gi usually paid a \\nvisit to the school when he returned from a lengthy special assignment. He \\npicked up the receiver. \\n\\\" ... In any event, I plan to see you today or tomorrow. You must have \\nbeen quite busy at school-has anything happened while I've been gone?\\\" \\nThus he greeted the teacher. At heart he quite expected to hear some \\npraise for his son. \\n\\\"Well, no. Nothing new. But there is something I'd like to discuss.\\\" \\n\\\"What is it about?\\\" \\n\\\"It has to do with Chaeshik, but it's no great cause for concern. I'd like to \\nvisit you this evening.\\\" \\n\\\"No. I'll come to the school. Please wait for me.\\\" \\nIt was the first time a phone call with Chaeshik's teacher had ended so un\\u00ad\\nsatisfactorily. \\nWhat could it be? If it were good news, it oughtn't to be so difficult to express. \\nFor him, a short winter's day had never seemed so tediously long. \\nThe teacher in charge of Chaeshik's class was a young man just over thirty \\nwho had a very composed and introspective nature that Chun' gi found pleas\\u00ad\\ning. Moreover, he felt trust and respect for the man. \\nThe teacher received Chun'gi as warmly as ever. \\n\\\"I should have called on you. I'm sorry you had to come here.\\\" After \\nChun'gi sat down, the teacher, with an apologetic look, spoke in a low voice \\nas if taking care lest someone hear. \\n\\\"Not at all. I haven't been able to do my duty as a parent, having to go on \\ntrips and leaving my child in his teacher's care. So, what is this about?\\\" \\nSorry for having asked so abruptly, Chun' gi rephrased the question: \\n\\\"Could it be, perhaps, that my boy Chaeshik has done something improper?\\\" \\nhe asked. He studied the teacher's face intently lest he miss any change in \\nexpression. \\n\\\"Oh, no. Nothing like that. How could Chaeshik do anything of the \\nkind?\\\" The teacher was rather taken aback. His eyes, which usually seemed \\nlost in deep thought, opened wide; he was at a loss, sorry for having troubled \\nChun'gi. THE SON 199 \\nObserving this reaction, Chun'gi let his breath escape as he relaxed some\\u00ad\\nwhat. \\n\\\"Is something weighing on your mind? Let's talk openly. Ours is a good \\nworld where the teachers show more concern for the children than do the \\nparents. If we were back in the time of the J aps .... \\\" \\nChun' gi's rancor deepened as he thought anew of the harsh treatment he \\nhad received from the J ap teachers during those years when he was not able \\nto pay his monthly fees. \\n\\\"But conditions are so good today that parents like me can simply entrust \\ntheir children to the school and know they have few concerns. So, does that \\nboy Chaeshik keep up in his studies?\\\" \\n\\\"By all means. As far as that goes, well ... The thing that concerns me \\nabout Chaeshik ... \\\"The teacher broke off and looked across at Chun'gi. \\nUnconsciously, Chun'gi drew in his breath. \\n\\\"It's in the area of group activities.\\\" \\n\\\"What? Group activities?\\\" \\n\\\"Yes. Several days ago there was a severe blizzard. We had organized a \\nforced march for several of the classes, and our class was one of them. We \\nwere to cross Liberation Hill and return .... \\\" \\n\\\"Liberation Hill? That hill is so steep they used to call it 'Panting Hill' in \\nthe old days. But now it's paved for cars.\\\" \\n\\\"Of course, you've lived in this district all along-so you should know it \\nwell!\\\" \\n\\\"I know it indeed. Many memorable events have taken place there,\\\" said \\nChun' gi, sighing a bit. \\n\\\"It's about fifteen Ii to the mine on the other side of the hill, isn't it?\\\" \\n\\\"Easily fifteen Ii.\\\" \\n\\\"So it was a thirty-Ii march both ways. Because of various other school ac\\u00ad\\ntivities, only one teacher took charge and left with them. I myself did not go. \\nNo stragglers were left and the march was evaluated as l).aving been very \\nproductive. But a few days ago at a Youth Corps evaluation meeting I was \\nsurprised to learn that Chaeshik had not joined in the march. He was criti\\u00ad\\ncized for it, especially since he is a Corps leader; whether he could have set \\nthe pace is beside the point.\\\" \\nThe local Youth Corps group had made plans to put together a bulletin \\nboard newspaper for that day. Chaeshik had dropped out of the forced march \\nto work alone until late that night to finish the newspaper and, getting to \\nschool before the others early the next morning, he posted it on the bulletin \\nboard. \\n\\n----- PAGE 110: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n200 KIM PUKHYANG \\n\\\"Since it all seemed reasonable, I didn't look into it. But when the meeting \\nended, I sat puzzled for a long time. I couldn't get up, as if a great weight \\nrested on my shoulders. Chaeshik had known there was going to be a forced \\nmarch-why would he choose to make up the newspaper on that particular \\nday? Even if it took him all night, couldn't he have done it earlier? \\n\\\"Shouldn't we also consider the fact that he missed the tree-planting last \\nfall and wasn't present at the Youth Corps conference? I can't dismiss the in\\u00ad\\nference. But, then, perhaps I am going too far with my impressions.\\\" \\nThe teacher looked worried. But then Chun'gi, who was deeply affected \\nby the teacher's cautious remarks, spoke up. \\n\\\"Not at all. What you say is for the sake of our children. Parents should un\\u00ad\\nderstand and learn from the commitment of such an educator. You shouldn't \\nhesitate to speak up.\\\" \\nHe took out a pack of cigarettes and, offering one to the teacher, lit one \\nfor himself. The teacher accepted the cigarette readily. After one or two puffs \\nhe stubbed it out in an ashtray and continued speaking. \\n\\\"At any rate, in this case I tried analyzing Chaeshik's life, as far as I know \\nit. This also meant an investigation of myself as a teacher. As the Premier has \\ntaught us, unless you are a revolutionary you cannot be a teacher. I realized \\nonce again how heavy a teacher's responsibility is. Speaking frankly, I had the \\nself-conceit to think I was doing everything a teacher should do. But when I \\nexamined myself, I felt as if I had been standing on top of a steep precipice .. \\nUntil recently I assumed that Chaeshik studied well and, as a Corps leader, \\nfaithfully carried out the editorial duties assigned him by the group. And so, \\nat every evaluation, I praised him as a model, a standard for judging other \\nstudents. But Chaeshik's nonconformity forced me to realize a hard truth \\nthat, particularly with a student like him, the slightest mistake must be \\nclosely examined and strict control applied.\\\" \\nThe teacher lit a match for Chun' gi, who had been trying to draw on his \\ncigarette, unaware that it had gone out. \\nChun' gi only then noticed the white ash sitting on his cigarette and, giv\\u00ad\\ning an embarrassed laugh, took the proffered light and puffed. \\nHe wished the teacher would go on with what he was saying. Chun'gi had \\nmany times sat with the teacher like this but never before seen him so cau\\u00ad\\ntious. And these things he was saying in a low voice, like a whisper, were \\ntouching Chun'gi. The teacher went on. \\n\\\"As a teacher, I thought it quite proper to excuse Chaeshik openly from \\nmost extracurricular activities since editing the bulletin board newspaper \\ntakes time. I didn't even pay much attention to his absences from meetings. \\nAnd all the while, the students and I, the Youth Corps leadership, and even / THE SON 201 \\nChaeshik thought everything was quite all right. So what need had Chaeshik \\nto say anything further? But, as a Youth Corps leader, Chaeshik ought to be \\nan activist; he must work harder than anyone else and take the lead in diffi\\u00ad\\ncult tasks. That is, he must stand out from among the others in class, not only \\nworking with them but also doing better than them. All the while, he is ex-\\npected to produce, as scheduled, the bulletin board newspaper, which is his \\nresponsibility. Where he ought to be exemplary in all his duties, Chaeshik \\nhas concentrated his efforts on his newspaper duties-for which he has been \\npraised-and let it go at that. So it appears that Chaeshik doesn't show the \\ncorrect recognition for and attitude toward the many duties of the group. \\nThe responsibility is mine for not giving him his proper guidance. As in the \\ncase of the forced march, it was the teachers who should have been in the \\nforefront, setting an example. On this score I plan to examine myself merci\\u00ad\\nlessly. And I am also thinking of ways to awaken Chaeshik to his errors and \\nset him on the right path to improvement.\\\" \\nThe teacher, his body slightly bent as if immobilized by a heavy burden, \\ngazed intently at Chun' gi. \\nBut Chun'gi only sat-silent, head down, a long-dead cigarette still in his \\nfingers-like someone who had been scolded and didn't know how to an\\u00ad\\nswer. An awkward silence settled between the two. \\nAt that moment another instrnctor came by to say something to \\nChaeshik's teacher, and the embarrassing situation was averted. \\nBut when the teacher finished talking and had left, Chun' gi quickly rose \\nand picked up his fur cap from the desk. \\n\\\"I'm sorry you have been given this worry. I'll see you again,\\\" he said and \\noffered his hand to the teacher. \\nChun' gi and the teacher separated. The teacher's handshake had been \\nfirmer than usual. \\nIt was dark outside. In the gloom, the snowflakes fluttered heavily like scat\\u00ad\\ntered moths. Though usually happy and satisfied when he left the school \\ngates after a visit, Chun'gi this time stepped out into the street with a heavy \\ntread, his heart sad and stinging like a wound. He could not come to grips \\nwith this state of things. He wondered, mightn't the teacher have carried his \\nconcern a little too far? \\nBut Chun'gi knew this was a time for careful action, standing firmly on \\nprinciple. As he grew older, he saw how the slightest mistake in thought or \\naction could affect human destinies; he himself, indeed, had experienced it. \\nShould he not, as a father, reconsider his own attitude toward his son? As he \\nwalked the unpeopled snowy streets where the night was now deep, the voice \\n\\n----- PAGE 111: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n202 KIM PUKHYANG \\nof the teacher still seemed to be ringing whisper like in Chun' gi's ears. He re\\u00ad\\nflected intently on how he had trained his son and how Chaeshik was devel\\u00ad\\noping at home. \\nSuddenly, Chun'gi was startled to realize that he and his wife, as parents, \\nhad been raising their son in much the same way that the teacher had han\\u00ad\\ndled Chaeshik's leadership in the Youth Corps. \\nChun'gi thought with deep regret of his own early years, when he had \\nstruggled with hunger, trembled in rags, and not been able to study, in spite \\nof his desire to do so. He wanted all the more to feed and clothe his son with\\u00ad\\nout worry and, further, let him study to his heart's content in this good, so\\u00ad\\ncialist world where he was growing up. For his son's studies, he would spare \\nnothing to give him all he asked. \\nHis sincerity of purpose and expectations of his son were not lost in vain \\ndreams. Chaeshik was enthusiastic in his studies and proper in decorum, and \\nalways carried his work through with highest grades. The days when he \\nwould come home with a perfect report card were, indeed, quite like festival \\ndays. Chun' gi would buy his son a congratulatory gift, and his wife would set \\na table as if for a birthday feast. \\nBut in thinking back he could see a huge mistake in this behavior. While a \\nstudent should do well at his studies, he also has, though young, certain so\\u00ad\\ncial, family, and moral duties as a member of society, as a son to his parents, \\nand as an older or younger brother. When there is work to be done, even \\nthough not his own, he must roll up his sleeves and stand forth, helping when \\nhis neighbor's work is arduous and doing his part when his parents are \\nbusy .... But Chun'gi and his wife were intent only upon having Chaeshik \\nstudy; from the start they had never let him lift a finger to work around the \\nhouse or neighborhood. If Chaeshik got up early to sweep the yard, they \\nwould take away the broom and, telling him to study, push him back into his \\nroom. Lest he notice ashes in the firebox, they would clean them out as soon \\nas they collected. And when Chun'gi was to leave on a long-term special as\\u00ad\\nsignment, he would chop up enough kindling ahead of time and stack it away \\nin the shed. For fear their son would lay hand to such tasks, the parents \\nwould rest easily only if they kept work away from him. As a result, Chaeshik \\nhad only to study without touching a broom, working with a hatchet, or car\\u00ad\\nrying out the ash-bucket; he didn't have to care for his younger brother and \\nsisters or calm them when they bickered. In time, Chaeshik came to believe \\nthat hard study alone was a kind of be-all and end-all for him. Had not \\nChaeshik forgotten the moral and civic duties of the new generation, which \\nis expected to move forward, shouldering the future of the country, the so\\u00ad\\ncialist fatherland? THE SON 203 \\nWhen he realized that Chaeshik's dropping out of the forced work march \\nwas by no means coincidental, Chun' gi became aware that he had been re\\u00ad\\nmiss. Chun'gi was even more deeply concerned when his thoughts turned to \\nChaeshik's failure to cross over Liberation Hill. He recognized that the \\nproblem did not involve Chaeshik alone but was also a question of his duties \\nas a father responsible for his son's training. \\nWhen his wife noticed that he returned home distracted, as though he \\nhad been arguing, she guessed right off that something unpleasant had hap\\u00ad\\npened and thought better of asking any questions. \\nKim-shi went silently out to the kitchen and, as silently, came in with the \\nsupper table, which she placed in front of her husband. \\nChun'gi normally ate like a youth, with a hearty appetite-always clean\\u00ad\\ning his rice bowl. But this evening he just nibbled at a few spoonfuls of rice, \\nand, pushing the table away, went straight to bed. \\nIt was the next morning. \\nThe snow was still falling as before. \\nChun' gi shook Chaeshik awake. \\n\\\"That's enough. Let's get up and clear the snow. Come along, now.\\\" \\n\\\"What? I've got to study,\\\" mumbled Chaeshik carelessly, stretching and \\npulling tl1e quilt over himself. \\n\\\"Study is study but you must also breathe the fresh morning air and get \\nsome exercise.\\\" \\nChun' gi got Chaeshik up, saw that his bedding was folded away, and led \\nhim outside. Chaeshik, his cheeks puffed up, grumbled unintelligibly as he \\nput on his shoes. \\n\\\"Why are you getting the boy out to clear that little yard? It's no bigger \\nthan the palm of your hand! Not leaving him to study,'' scolded his wife from \\nthe kitchen, where she had been making breakfast. \\n\\\"What do you have in mind, acting like that this morning?\\\" \\nChun'gi, not heeding his wife, made no response and gave the shovel to \\nhis son. \\n\\\"Don't just stand there. Take the snow-shovel and try pushing it,'' said \\nChun'gi as he took a broom and began sweeping snow. \\nChaeshik picked up the shovel but just scraped at the ground where he \\nstood. Chun'gi took the shovel from Chaeshik and, grasping the handle, \\npushed through the snow to the far side of the yard and came back. \\n\\\"Now you try pushing straight through like that. When you work, what\\u00ad\\never the job, you should do it willingly. Only then will the work be well done \\nand productive. From now on, you must help with tasks at home. And, at \\n\\n----- PAGE 112: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n204 KIM PUKHYANG \\nschool, work hard in group activities,\\\" he said, giving the shovel back to his \\nson. \\nChaeshik had no choice. He braced the handle against his stomach and set \\nout at a normal pace, pushing the snow ahead. \\nAs Chun' gi sat up late that night, studying his daily readings from works \\nof the beloved Leader, he felt greatly inspired. In the light of the Leader's \\nteaching that the school, the family, and society must all share responsibility \\nfor the education and training of youth, Chun' gi seriously criticized himself \\nas a father and as the parent of a schoolchild. \\nFrom that day on, Chun'gi kept in closer contact with the teacher and \\ntook a more active role in Chaeshik's life, trying to correct him at each step \\nso that he would commit himself to group and organizational activities. \\nWhile upholding his standards of study, he assigned more household tasks to \\nhis son. \\nThough Kim-shi was not satisfied at first, Chun' gi helped her understand; \\nand, when Chaeshik's teacher visited and she heard him out, Kim-shi seemed \\nto have been awakened, for she did not take her son's side. \\nAt school, Chaeshik was assigned a new edition of the bulletin board \\nnewspaper to get him more involved with the young people's movement. Ef\\u00ad\\nforts were also made to have him participate actively in meetings and group \\naffairs. \\nFor this reason, perhaps, Chaeshik was a different person, even when he \\nwas at home. He would get out and clear the snow whenever his father asked \\nhim to, and when his mother was busy in the kitchen he would go in and \\ncarry out the ash-bucket for her. But for all this, his heart was not really in \\nthe work. Though he seemed eagerly devoted to his studies and to editing \\nthe bulletin board newspaper, he was doing his other tasks rather sluggishly \\nand unwillingly-as if he were helping someone else out. \\nThen one day, when Chaeshik was given his first new assignment since that \\nof editing the bulletin board newspaper, Chun' gi was asked by the teacher \\nwhat he thought of it. Chaeshik had been told to gather samples of new ore \\nat the mines beyond Liberation Hill as an extracurricular task for geography \\nstudies; he was also to produce a special edition on minerals for the bulletin \\nboard to point out to students the mineral nature of our country. The teacher \\nset a deadline for the work, based on Chaeshik's ability to take on the extra \\ntask while editing the bulletin board newspaper. \\nChun'gi understood the teacher's intentions. \\n\\\"That'll be fine,\\\" he agreed quickly. THE SON 205 \\nThe intent of this special assignment, while asking Chaeshik to partici\\u00ad\\npate actively in the usual organizational affairs, was to train him to carry out \\nany task given him by the organization, without question and uncondition\\u00ad\\nally. This would train him not to think, as he did, that his duty was done once \\nhe had finished the bulletin board work the Youth Corps assigned him. \\nMerely having Chaeshik climb Liberation Hill, which he had previously \\navoided doing by missing the group forced march, was not a pointless \\nexercise. \\nChun' gi, as concerned about this assignment as though he himself were \\ncharged with it, was at a loss for what to do. \\nWhen Chaeshik came home he sat mumbling at his desk until late at night \\nwriting copy for the new edition of the bulletin board newspaper and seemed \\nto have forgotten all about going to the mines. \\nChun' gi found himself watching his son's behavior closely while vainly \\nfretting. When Chaeshik was at home he would worry that.he wasn't think\\u00ad\\ning of going; and when he wasn't there, he would ask his wife, \\\"Hasn't \\nChaeshik gone over the hill to the mines yet?\\\" \\nAlthough Chun'gi wanted to prod his son, he wanted to wait for the right \\nmoment. It seemed to him that the slightest mistake would give the clear im\\u00ad\\npression that home and school were conspiring with each other, against \\nChaeshik. \\nWhen Chun'gi visited the school one day when the bulletin board news\\u00ad\\npaper was nearly done and close to the day Chaeshik had to go to the mines, \\nhe learned clearly from the teacher how the revolutionary tasks assigned by \\nthe Youth Corps organization were working out. He heard that they were \\nstressing a study of the group and organizational life of the Children's \\nBrigade at the time of the unarmed anti-Japanese struggle. He also learned \\nthat Chaeshik was to present research on the recollections of revolutionary \\nactivity by the youth Mok Unshik, who had been a member of the Children's \\nBrigade. \\nHe left the school after exchanging views with the teacher on Chaeshik's \\nlife guidance, still feeling that he was ineffectual as a parent. \\nOn his way, Chun' gi dropped by the library to borrow factual materials on \\nthe struggle of the youth Mok Unshik and read them through, then and \\nthere. He had once before read these recollections. But, for some reason, he \\nwas overwhelmed this time by emotions more deeply felt than ever before. \\nBefore his eyes appeared first the indelible image of Mok Unshik climbing \\nstep by step up the steep path to the ridge-snow-covered even though it was \\nspring-and then the miserable sight of his stoic courage as his right foot, \\n\\n----- PAGE 113: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n206 KIM PUKHYANG \\nthe straw sandal still on, was thrust into a firebox, red with coals, when he \\nwould not turn over a communication. \\nWhat a bright lad he was! No matter what charge the organization gave him, \\nhowever he had to live, fight, or die for the revolution, he sacrificed his only life. Thus \\nhe teaches us, appeals to us! \\nChun' gi thought again of his own behavior-ashamed both as a fighter \\nfor the Leader and as a father who did not train his son to be one of the new \\ngeneration that is to carry forward the revolution. \\nChun'gi took the factual materials on Mok Unshik with him and gave \\nthem to his son. \\n\\\"Study these well. Then let us discuss them.\\\" \\nChun'gi worked even harder at leading and training his son. When \\nChaeshik had studied Mok Unshik's recollections of revolutionary activities, \\nChun'gi spoke to his son of his own study and thoughts about the in\\u00ad\\ndomitable young revolutionary fighter, awakening the boy to how important \\nrevolutionary, organizational activity is in our lives. \\nOn a Saturday morning, two days before the deadline for bringing back \\nthe mineral samples, Chaeshik finally spoke to Chun'gi. \\n\\\"Father! I must go over Liberation Hill to the mines and back. ... Can \\nyou get me a ride tomorrow?\\\" he asked. \\n\\\"A ride?\\\" \\nChun'gi repeated the words as by rote, unable to add anything further \\nright away. He thought for a while before replying. \\n\\\"I'll try to find out. But why are you depending upon me for what you \\nmust do? You should have a self-reliant spirit. If, perhaps, you can't get a ride, \\nwon't you go where you must? You must go even though you walk!\\\" \\nAs Chun'gi thought of his feckless son who couldn't carry out an assign\\u00ad\\nment given him by the organization, he felt sick at heart for having been \\nblinded earlier by unquestioning love for his son. \\nChaeshik did not protest his father's scolding but sullenly picked up his \\nbook bag and went to school. \\nAll the same, Chun'gi did telephone several government offices and en\\u00ad\\nterprises in town on his way to work to ask if there would be a car going to \\nthe mines. He found there would be. \\nBut Chun'gi, telephone receiver in hand, suddenly realized he was asking \\nthat busy cars be stopped for his son's private business; he couldn't easily an\\u00ad\\nswer the question from the other end as to why he was asking and, equivo\\u00ad\\ncating, simply hung up. \\nEven so, he somehow did not feel regret. Not having spoken was, after all, \\nthe better course, he thought. THE SON 207 \\nWhen Chun' gi got home that evening he spoke in such a way that \\nChaeshik knew he should not count on a ride. \\n\\\"Since you must go anyway, you'll have to walk.\\\" \\n\\\"Oh, this is really terrible,\\\" moaned Chaeshik to himself when he heard \\nthe disappointing news from his father. \\nIt was Sunday. Chun' gi had gone to his office and was straightening his \\ndesk after clearing up some work he hadn't quite finished the day before \\nwhen, suddenly, his wife came hurrying in. \\n\\\"Is something the matter?\\\" \\nHis wife, panting heavily, said that Chaeshik had just left, saying that he \\nwas going to the mines. With the weather so bad, what is to be done? she was \\nasking. \\nChun' gi set down his work and listened quietly to his wife. \\n\\\"He said that it was confirmed yesterday at the Youth Corps meeting that \\nhe is to bring the mineral samples. I couldn't get him to go another day-he \\nwouldn't listen.\\\" \\nA look of concern filled his wife's eyes. \\nMaking no reply at all to his wife's words, Chun'gi looked silently out the \\nwindow. \\nA snowy wind shook the window roughly. \\nChun' gi was himself quite concerned that his son had gone out into a bliz\\u00ad\\nzard as harsh as today. \\nBut, the next moment, Chun'gi shook his head. \\nNo. He must make Chaeshik bring back the ore samples, even though he \\npushed through a blizzard. He surely had to carry out the task assigned him \\nby the Youth Corps organization and, through that process, renew his com\\u00ad\\nmitment toward the organization. \\nHe had to make him a true son of the Leader, a prepared successor to the \\nage of proper devotion and revolution. \\n\\\"But, what can be done by just sitting? Even his teacher came to the house \\nand spoke of his concern.\\\" His wife, in frustration, had spoken again. \\nChun' gi turned to face his wife and scolded her. \\n\\\"Let's be done with that useless talk! There's no need for such worry. A \\nboy that age could catch a tiger and bring it back. What use is a child who has \\nonly been pampered while growing up? Now, you just go along home.\\\" \\nHe continued to sit where he was even after his disconcerted wife had left. \\nChun' gi was determined that his son would cross over the hill and return \\neven if he himself had to spur the boy on. With this thought, he cleared away \\nthe papers on his desk and headed out toward Liberation Hill. \\nHeavy flakes of snow were already falling, evenly and thickly. \\n\\n----- PAGE 114: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n208 KIM PUKHYANG \\nOut beyond the streets of the city, the blizzard was well under way. \\nThrough the fall of thick, fluttering snow, electric power poles, mountain \\nfoothills, and huge old trees in the distance seemed to come and go. \\nChun'gi walked quickly. \\nSnow that drifted on the sloping road was blown and piled again by the \\nwind. At some points Chun' gi sank in snow up to his ankles. The blizzard, \\nwhich had seemed to be blowing in from the distant plains, now swept down \\nfrom the mountain ridges to drift on the road and cover the valley deep in \\nwhite. \\nChun' gi quickened his pace. He rounded a bend and, halfway up the slope \\nahead, a black movement caught his eye. As Chun'gi rounded each bend it \\ndisappeared-seen and then not seen as if playing a game of hide-and-seek. \\nWhen the black movement was nearer, it grew larger and took on human \\nform. \\nIt was Chaeshik. \\n\\\"Right! It's Chaeshik crossing over the hill!\\\" \\nAt th~ sight of his son climbing through the blizzard, Chun'gi was greatly \\nreassured. \\nAs he gazed at his son, Chun'gi's face was wreathed in smiles. \\nHaving come around another turn in the mountain road-his heart filling \\nwith great joy and pride for his precious son-Chun' gi stopped short. While \\nhe had guessed as he walked that Chaeshik should already have rounded one \\nmore bend, wasn't the boy just idling by an old tree that stood at the edge of \\nthe cliff? \\nWhy's this? Is he resting? If not, is he looking around for something? \\nWhile Chun'gi watched with a troubled look in his eyes, Chaeshik started \\nup the hill again, as if with somehow renewed determination. The blizzard, \\nwhich had paused for a moment, now swept the trail again with drifts and \\nmoved on. \\nChun'gi rounded the bend and quickly looked up toward the crest of the \\nhill. \\nChaeshik was moving slowly, engulfed by the blizzard that buffeted \\nhim. \\nChun'gi ran up the slope and called, without being aware, \\\"Chaeshik!\\\" \\nEnveloped in the blizzard, Chaeshik appeared only as a shape bent against \\nthe wind. His back was turned, as ifhe had not heard his father's call. \\n\\\"Chaeshik!\\\" \\nWhen Chun'gi called a second time, Chaeshik lifted his face, red with the \\ncold, inside a fur cap that was white with frost. \\n\\\"Father!\\\" THE SON 209 \\nAs soon as Chaeshik recognized his father standing square in front of him \\nlike a wall, he ran, nearly falling, to Chun' gi's embrace and burst into tears of \\n)Oy. \\nChun' gi hugged his son tightly and then spoke in a quiet voice. \\n\\\"Chaeshik! Let's cross over the hill. How can you turn back on what \\nyou've started?\\\" \\nWith this he turned his son around and, taking the lead, kicked a path \\nthrough the snow ahead. \\nChaeshik seemed to gain courage and followed his father's lead. \\n\\\"Father, I'm all right,\\\" he said, reassuring his father, who was making a \\npath for him. \\nBut they hadn't gone far when his exhaustion made it difficult for him to \\nwalk and he fell behind his father. \\nAs Chun'gi kicked his way through the snow, he thought with deep feel\\u00ad\\ning of the times when as a youth he had crossed over this hill on his way to \\nschool. In those days Chun'gi had fulfilled the heartfelt wish of his father, \\nwho barely eked out a living in the Jap mines, by attending an elementary \\nschool located where Chaeshik's school now stood. But today was the first \\ntime he had crossed over this hill for the sake of his own son's training, and \\nhe was swept by a wave of emotion. This road-once barely wide enough for \\na donkey trail-that he had crossed back and forth in snow or rain without \\nmissing a day; this hill, over which he had once flown on the endless wings of \\neager desire for learning; this hill he had gazed at through his tears both \\nmorning and night-like a distant, thousand-league pass-when going and \\ncoming from the mines after he was finally kicked out of school for failing to \\npay the monthly fees; this hill-which had been paved with a broad, new \\nroad after liberation-where he would now ride instead of walk, charged \\nwith various responsibilities. \\nChun' gi was looking back, eyes brimming with tears, at his son trudging \\nthrough the snow. \\nChaeshik had covered his nose and mouth with his mittens, and, when the \\nblizzard was too much to bear, he would turn and walk backward. \\nAs he watched his son attentively, Chun' gi's face gradually grew hard and \\nexpressionless. After wavering between anger at himself and encouragement \\nfor his son, Chun' gi spoke out in a loud voice. \\n\\\"Brace up! If your heart is firmly set, even the rocks make way for you!\\\" \\nWhen Chun'gi spoke thus, Chaeshik would hurry and catch up with his \\nfather, only to fall behind again after a while. \\nAs Chaeshik plodded up the steepening slope he would look back from \\ntime to time, his eyes showing concern as if he were waiting for something. \\n\\n----- PAGE 115: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n210 KIM PUKHYANG \\nSometimes he would flip open an earflap and listen intently. But then, dis\\u00ad\\nappointed, he would grumble to himself. \\n\\\"Oh! Why today, of all days, must the weather be like this?\\\" \\nFor Chaeshik, winter was a happy season when they would study in a cozy \\nclassroom and then, at recess, go out to the playground to have fights in the \\nsnow that so delighted them. Or, on the way to school each day, he and his \\ncomrades would play noisily in the streets, singing songs or rolling over and \\nover in the snow. \\nBut this winter had been more lonely and difficult to bear than any he had \\nknown. \\nHis head, brow, and cheeks were hot and flushed, soaked with sticky \\nsweat; the unpleasantly slimy feel, like some queer insect, put him in a bad \\nmood. His body was so bathed in sweat that each time the cold air slipped in \\nthrough his collar goose pimples ran down his spine. He regretted being \\ndressed in so many layers of clothing. \\nBut there are uiually so many cars-where have they gone today? Not a sign of \\none here! Oh! \\nChaeshik, panting from the effort to catch up with his father way ahead, \\ncouldn't make even half the distance before he had to stop and catch his \\nbreath. He looked back again. \\nHis eyes burned as if they were on fire. \\nBut all he could see was just an expanse of white; all he could hear was the \\nscream of the blizzard. \\nChaeshik was getting angry. \\\"Oh, this is wretched!\\\" he grumbled to \\nhimself. \\nNot caring how far he had fallen behind, he did not try to catch up but \\nplodded heavily as if on leaden feet. \\nThen, at the sound of a horn from somewhere in the distance, he stopped, \\nstartled, listening intently. With a heart fervently hoping it was coming up \\nthe hill, he turned and looked back. At a lower bend, where the blizzard had \\njust swept past, a black object suddenly appeared. \\nThe instant he recognized it, Chaeshik dashed up the hill like a champion \\nsprinter, seized with unexpected strength. \\n\\\"Father! It's a truck!\\\" he cried. \\nBut his father, not seeming to hear, did not look back. Just then, as if in \\nunderstanding of Chaeshik's state of mind, the truck's loud horn sounded \\nagain. Perhaps startled by the metallic sound, the blizzard suddenly quieted; \\nfor Chaeshik, the cold and lonely hill filled instantly with the friendly vitality \\nof a city street. \\nBut still there was no reaction from his father. As Chaeshik was about to THE SON 211 \\ncall out again in frustration, the truck drew abreast of him, sounding its horn. \\nHe moved to the side of the road and waved his right arm. \\n\\\"Driver! Please give me a ride!\\\" \\nThe truck was loaded with freight and there was no one in the cab but the \\ndriver. The driver, who had a broad face and appeared friendly, looked toward \\nChaeshik with a pleasant smile, but drove on. Chaeshik chased after the truck. \\n\\\"Driver, ... \\\"he called, pleading. But there was no need to dash after the \\ntruck. It pulled to a stop beside his father. Well, that's it. Chaeshik's mouth \\nopened wide as he ran, kicking the snow ahead of him. \\nHis father was saying something to the driver, who had opened the door \\nof the cab. It seemed to Chaeshik that his kind father was asking the driver to \\ngive him a seat in the cab. \\nBut that wouldn't do. Father should ride there. I should ride in the freight com\\u00ad\\npartment. In such cold ... \\n\\\"Father, you ride up front!\\\" he said, when he got to the truck, and started \\nto crawl up into the freight compartment. \\nBut what happened? Father would not get in the truck. The door \\nslammed shut and the engine began to roar. \\nFather, who had waited gruffly until then, approached Chaeshik. \\n\\\"Chaeshik, let's you and I walk!\\\" he said, placing a hand on Chaeshik's \\nshoulder. Chaeshik had not caught the low tone in his father's voice. \\n\\\"Father, why do we have to do that?\\\" he protested, about to burst into \\ntears. \\nTo Chun'gi, it felt as if the voice of his son were cutting like a knife into \\nhis heart. \\nBut he ignored the pain. \\nHe thought it would be best to send the truck on its way. If they rode over \\nthe hill they would reach the mines early but without trial. Could one some\\u00ad\\nhow expect only favorable conditions for carrying out an assignment given \\nby the organization? Must it not, finally, be carried out no matter how diffi\\u00ad\\ncult and strenuous the conditions or hardships? He must awaken his son's \\nwhole-hearted understanding that such was the nature of organizational \\nduty, which must be carried out! Even were another truck to come, they \\nwould have to let it pass by and cross over on foot! \\nTo the father this seemed the first time that his son had ever protested to \\nhim. Even Chaeshik himself could not imagine how he could be so disre\\u00ad\\nspectful to his father. \\nThe father, quite surprised, looked him over closely; his face, which had \\njust grown stern, seemed to furrow as if bearing severe pain. Even in his tone \\nof voice, the father showed distress. \\n\\n----- PAGE 116: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n212 KIM PUKHYANG \\n\\\"Chaeshik, how could I not understand what you feel?

Aware that he could not go \\nagainst his father's wishes, Chaeshik let go of the edge of the truck's freight \\ncompartment, which he had stood on tiptoe to reach. \\nThe truck departed, leaving the air filled with the smell of gasoline. \\nChaeshik gazed at the disappearing truck with eyes more angry than sad. \\n\\\"Chaeshik! Let's go!\\\" \\nWakened by his father's voice, Chaeshik turned around. \\nHis father waited for Chaeshik to come near and then, putting a shelter\\u00ad\\ning arm around his son's shoulders, walked slowly as he spoke to him. \\n\\\"If we stop a busy mining truck for our personal business, think how much \\nwe interrupt the work of carrying ore to the furnaces ... even though we are \\nheaded the same way. What would happen if lots of people all stopped \\ntrucks? Think it over.\\\" \\nHis father's affectionate voice soothed Chaeshik's pent-up heart. \\n\\\"You studied the youth Mok Unshik of the Children's Brigade, who grew \\nup in the embrace of Marshal Kim Il Sung-how faithful he was in his group \\nand organizational life? How they dedicated their lives to carrying out the \\nrevolutionary tasks assigned them by the organization? Chaeshik! I hope that \\nyou'll turn out like them! Of course you can get a ride over this hill; but, even \\nwithout a ride, you still must go-as I hope you will. Like a member of the \\nChildren's Brigade, faithful to the Leader!\\\" \\nChaeshik's heart overflowed with love. For the first time in his life he felt \\nthe warm love flowing out from his father. He cried Father! within his heart, \\nwhile hot tears gushed out from his eyes. \\nHis heart swelled with an emotion he had not known before. This wave of \\nfeeling gave Chaeshik strength and helped quicken his pace. A new tough\\u00ad\\nness possessed him as he energetically kicked a path through the drifts ahead \\nof his father and on up the hill. \\nChun'gi watched his son from behind, reassured. \\nAt this moment the figure of a man appeared behind him. \\n\\\"Chaeshik's father? I'm so glad to see you. Doesn't he look strong and de\\u00ad\\npendable!\\\" \\nIt was Chaeshik's smiling teacher, who was standing in the spot where \\nChaeshik had stood. The teacher laughed softly, blinking his eyes, his brows \\ncovered with snow. It was the happy smile seen only on the face of a truly \\npleased teacher. THE SON 213 \\nAfter learning that Chaeshik had left, the teacher had gone back to school \\nbefore setting out. In so doing, he had fallen behind Chun'gi. He had come \\nto help Chaeshik along. At the same time, he was aware that he, too, had \\nmissed the earlier forced march, and he wanted to make up for it. \\nChun' gi grasped the teacher's hand tightly without a word. \\nChun'gi and the teacher gazed with trust at Chaeshik up ahead, as they \\nwalked together, hands clasped firmly. \\nIt was one month later. \\nChun' gi was on his way back from a special assignment at the mines, when \\nhe stopped at the ridge of Liberation Hill. Suddenly, the column of a forced \\nmarch from the middle school came into view. \\nAt the head of the column marched the teacher, and Chaeshik.\",\n          \"HYON CHINGON \\nA LUCKY DAY \\nThere was an unfriendly murkiness in the sky that suggested snow, \\nbut the snow did not come, only a frozen rain that kept dripping, dripping \\ndown. \\nToday was the first lucky day in a long time to come the way of Kim \\nCh'omji, a rickshaw man who worked on the city side ofTongsomun. It be\\u00ad\\ngan with the woman in the house opposite who wanted to go downtown. He \\ntook her to the tram-stop, and then, in the hope of getting another fare, he \\nwandered around the depot, turning imploring eyes on each person who got \\noff a tram, until finally he got a fare to Tonggwang School, a man dressed in \\nWestern clothes who looked like a teacher. \\nThe first run was thirty chon; the second, fifty chOn. Not a bad omen to \\nstart the day! Kim Ch' omji had been in such utterly bad luck that he hadn't \\nseen the sight of money for ten days, but the jingle now of three ten-ch'i5n \\nnickel coins, followed by five more, falling into the palm of his hand was al\\u00ad\\nmost enough to bring tears of joy. For him, today, the value of this eighty \\nchon was inestimable. Not only would he be able to slake his thirst with a \\ndrink, but he would be able to buy a bowl of sol!Ongt'ang for his ailing wife. \\nHis wife had been racked by a cough for more than six weeks. And in cir\\u00ad\\ncumstances where even a bowl of millet was difficult to get, it goes without \\nsaying that she had had no medicine. It wasn't that medicine was completely \\nout of the question. To some extent at least Kim Ch'omji was being true to \\nhis belief that if you give medicine to get rid of the demon of disease, the de\\u00ad\\nmon will get to like it and keep coming back for more. For this reason he \\nhadn't had a doctor look at her, and so he didn't really know what was wrong \\nwith her. However, her condition was obviously serious in view of the fact \\nthat she was lying down all the time, quite unable to turn on her side, much \\nless get up. \\nHer condition had become worse ten days ago when a bowl of millet she \\nate lay on her stomach. Kim Ch'omji had just got his hands on some money \\nafter a long lean spell. He bought her a little millet and a ten-chon bundle of A LUCKY DAY \\nwood, and then the damn woman, in Kim's own words, had been completely \\nreckless. She had thrown the whole lot into a pot to boil, but before the fire \\nturned red hot, too impatient to wait for it to cook, the damn woman dis\\u00ad\\npensed with the spoon and began scooping up the half-cooked millet with \\nher hands. Acting as if she feared someone was going to take it away from \\nher, she began stuffing it into her mouth till her cheeks looked like a pair of \\nfist-size tumors. By evening she was complaining of a tightness in her breast, \\nher stomach was cramped, her eyes were wide and staring; she was having a \\nfit. Kim Ch' omji was really angry. \\n\\\"Goddamn woman! It would be your luck! Sick when you don't eat, sick \\nwhen you do! What's to be done now? Can't you look straight?\\\" he cried, and \\nhe slapped her once across the cheek. Her eyes came back a little into line, \\nbut there was a wet film clinging to them. Kim Ch'omji's eyes were burning, \\ntoo. \\nThe patient, however, didn't go off her food. For three days she badgered \\nher husband for sollongt'ang. \\n\\\"Damn woman. Can't even eat millet and here she is wanting beef soup! \\nStuff herself again and have another fit,\\\" he ranted. \\nInwardly, however, he had felt bad that he couldn't buy it for her. Now, \\nthough, he would be able to buy her the sollongt'ang. He would also be able \\nto buy food for the three-year-old child howling with hunger by her sick \\nmother's side. Kim Ch'omji, eighty chOn tight in his fist, had a feeling of \\nplenty. \\nHis good fortune didn't end there. Coming back out the school gate, wiping \\nthe mixture of sweat and rain that was running down the back of his neck \\nwith a greasy Japanese cotton handkerchief, he heard behind him a cry of \\n\\\"Rickshaw!\\\" Kim Ch'omji took one look at the person who had stopped to \\ncall him and guessed it was a student from the school. The student got \\nstraight to the point. \\n\\\"How much to South Gate Station?\\\" he asked. \\nThe boy was probably a boarder at the school going home for the winter \\nholidays. Probably he had made up his mind to go today, but with the rain \\nand having baggage as well, he had been at a loss to know what to do until he \\nspotted Kim Ch'omji. Otherwise why come running out after a rickshaw \\nman, shoes trailing behind, getting soaking wet-even if it was only a cheap \\ncotton uniform? \\n\\\"South Gate Station, you say?\\\" Kim Ch'omji hesitated. Could it be that \\nhe was reluctant to splash his way so far in this rain and without rain gear? Or \\nmight it be that he was satisfied with the first and second fares? No, not at all. \\n\\n----- PAGE 12: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n4 HYON CHINGON \\nIt was just that he was a little afraid of this strange good fortune that seemed \\nto be rushing in upon him. And there was also the fact that his wife's request, \\nas he left the house this morning after getting the call from the woman across \\nthe street, was still nagging at him. There was an imploring light in the sick \\nwoman's eyes, eyes that were unusually big and sunken, the only living things \\nin her fleshless face. \\n\\\"Don't go out today. Please, for my sake, stay home. I'm so sick .... \\\" Her \\nvoice was a murmur like the buzz of a mosquito, her breathing labored. \\nKim Ch'omji made light of it. \\n\\\"What are you saying? Whipped you should be, talking nonsense like \\nthat! Who do you think will feed and look after us if we sit here holding onto \\neach other?\\\" he said, but as he made to rush off, the sick woman reached out \\nher hand as if to hold him. \\n\\\"I wish you wouldn't go, but come back early,\\\" she said, her thin, throaty \\nwhisper following him out. \\nNow, the instant he heard that his fare wanted to go to the station, his \\nwife's convulsively trembling hands, her exceptionally big eyes, and her face \\non the point of tears danced before Kim Ch'omji's eyes. \\n\\\"Well, how much is it going to be to South Gate Station?\\\" the student \\nasked, looking impatiently at the rickshaw man's face, and then as if talking to \\nhimself, he mumbled, \\\"There's a train to Inch' on at eleven; is the next one at \\ntwo in the afternoon?\\\" \\n\\\"You'll have to give me one won fifty.\\\" \\nThe fare came out abruptly, before Kim Ch' orriji. realized it himself. He \\nwas shocked by the staggering sum of money, even though it came from his \\nown lips. What a long time it had been since he had even asked for a fare as \\nbig as this! The opportunity to earn this money overrode his concern for his \\nsick wife. Surely nothing would happen today? This bit of good luck was \\nmore than double the first and the second together. He felt he couldn't afford \\nto pass it up, no matter what. \\n\\\"One won fifty is too much,'' the student said, shaking his head. \\n\\\"The distance alone is more than fifteen li, and it's reasonable to pay a lit\\u00ad\\ntle more on a rainy day like this,\\\" the driver said, and a joy that could not be \\nhidden flowed across his face. \\n\\\"All right, I'll give what you ask,'' the generous young customer agreed. \\n\\\"But let's go quickly,'' he said and hurried off to change his clothes and get his \\nthings. \\nKim Ch'omji's legs felt strangely light when he got the student aboard. \\nHe went at a run; it was almost as if he were flying. And the wheels turned so A LUCKY DAY \\nfast it was like sliding on skates along ice. Actually the rain falling on the \\nfrozen ground had made it slippery. \\nThe driver's legs soon grew heavy. This was because he was coming near \\nhis own house. Renewed anxiety weighed on his chest. Don't go out today: I'm \\nso sick. The sick woman's whimpering echoed in his ears. Her deep-sunk eyes \\nseemed to glare at him in reproach. He could almost hear the wailing of the \\nchild. And he seemed to hear a gasping sound, a struggle to draw breath. \\n\\\"What's the matter, we'll miss the train.\\\" \\nThe impatient cry of the passenger barely got through to the driver. Real\\u00ad\\nity returned abruptly: Kim Ch' omji, hands still holding the shafts of the rick\\u00ad\\nshaw, was crouched down in the middle of the road-he had pulled up. \\n\\\"Yes, yes,'' Kim Ch'omji said, and he broke into a run again. The farther \\nhe got from his house the more life came back into his gait, as if the brisk \\nmovement of his legs was the only thing that could make him forget the \\nceaseless flow of anxiety and worry in his mind. \\nWhen Kim Ch'omji delivered his passenger at the station and he actually \\ngot that staggering one won fifty into his hand, he had no thought for the fif\\u00ad\\nteen li he had splashed through in the rain. He was as grateful as if he had got \\nthe money for nothing, as happy as if he had become a millionaire overnight. \\nSeveral times he bowed deeply to his young customer, who was young \\nenough to be his son. \\n\\\"Have a good trip,'' he added respectfully. \\nThe trip back in the rain with an empty, rattling rickshaw didn't bear \\nthinking about. The sweat of labor had run cold, and there was a chill welling \\nup from his soaking clothes that he could feel in his famished stomach and \\nthat gave him a heightened awareness of both the satisfaction and the an\\u00ad\\nguish of one won fifty. There was no strength left in his gait. He was huddled \\nup as he left the station, and he felt as if at any moment he might fall down \\nand not be able to get up again. \\n\\\"Damn rain! Rattling an empty rickshaw back in this rain! Why does this \\nbloody rain have to keep battering me in the face?\\\" \\nKim Ch' omji was violently angry, grumbling and complaining as if in de\\u00ad\\nfiance of someone. At this stage a new, bright idea flashed into his mind. This \\nis no way to do it, he thought. HI circle the area and wait for a train to come, \\nI could get another fare. He had been so lucky today, who could say he \\nwouldn't have another stroke of luck? He felt absolutely sure good fortune \\nwas waiting for him; he would have been willing to bet on it. However, he \\ncouldn't stand in front of the station because he was afraid of the regular rick\\u00ad\\nshaw men. So, he did what he had often done before: he parked the rickshaw \\n\\n----- PAGE 13: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\nHYON CHINGON \\nat a point between the tramlines and the footpath, a little way from the tram\\u00ad\\ncar depot opposite the station, and circled the area to survey the situation. A \\ntrain came after a little while, and quite a crowd poured out in the direction \\nof the tramcar depot. A woman caught Kim Ch'omji's fare-searching eye. \\nShe looked like a former kisaeng or a playgirl student; she had a Western \\nhairdo and wore high-heeled shoes and a cape thrown over her shoulders. \\nHe stole up beside her. \\n\\\"Rickshaw, ma'am?\\\" \\nStudent or not, she put on an exceedingly haughty expression for a mo\\u00ad\\nment. Her lips were sealed tight; she didn't spare Kim Ch'omji a glance. \\n\\\"I'll bring you a lot cheaper, ma'am, than the boys in the station. Where \\nare you going?\\\" \\nKim Ch6mji was nothing if not persistent. He laid his hand on the J apa-\\nnese wicker bag she was carrying. \\n\\\"How dare you pester people like this!\\\" she thundered, and she turned \\naway. \\nA tram came. Kim Ch' 6mji glared spitefully at the people who boarded it. \\nBut his instincts had not been wrong. When the tram, loaded to the last, be\\u00ad\\ngan to move, there was one man left behind. Judging by the huge bag he was \\ncarrying, it looked as if he had been put off by the conductor because his bag \\nwas too big for the crowded tram. Kim Ch'omji pulled over beside him. \\n\\\"Rickshaw?\\\" \\nThere was some stubborn haggling over the fare before Kim Ch'omji \\nagreed to bring him to Insa-dong for sixty chOn. \\nAll day long, when the rickshaw grew heavy, Kim Ch'omji's body felt \\nstrangely light, and when the rickshaw felt light, his body grew heavy. This \\ntime, however, anxiety ate right into his mind. A view of the house kept \\nshimmering in front of his eyes, so that now he couldn't think of more good \\nluck. His legs felt like stumps of trees, as if they did not belong to him, and \\nthe only way to keep them going was to drive them on and on, abusing them, \\nracing steadily forward. His pace was reckless enough to worry passersby: \\nhow could that damn rickshaw man be so drunk and still stay on his feet in \\nthis muck? \\nThere was a somberness in the overcast, rainy sky that made it seem as if it \\nwere already close to dusk. He slowed down passing Ch'anggyong Gardens \\nto catch his breath. Step after step, the nearer he got to home, the more he \\nfelt a strange calm penetrating into his mind. This calm was not coming from \\nany sense of security, rather it was springing from a fear born of a vivid real\\u00ad\\nization of the imminence of accumulated misfortune. He was writhing, try-A LUCKY DAY \\ning to prolong the time, at least a little, before he collided with calamity. He \\nwanted, if possible, to hold on for a long time to the joy of earnings that \\namounted almost to a miracle. He craned his neck, searching in all direc\\u00ad\\ntions. He gave the impression that he was completely powerless to do any\\u00ad\\nthing about his legs, which were racing toward his own house, that is, toward \\ncertain calamity, and would someone, anyone, grab him, save him? \\nJust then his friend Chisam emerged from a roadside drinking establish\\u00ad\\nment. Chisam's wrinkled, fat face was a purple glow, and jet whiskers covered \\nhis cheeks and chin, offering a striking contrast to the appearance of Kim \\nCh' 6mji, whose face was wizened and sallow, with furrows cut across it here \\nand there, and a skimpy beard that amounted to no more than a few inverted \\npine needles of stubble beneath his chin. \\n\\\"Hello, Kim Ch'omji! On your way back from the city, I see. Made a lot \\nof money, I presume. How about standing me a drink?\\\" cried the corpulent \\nChisam at the sight of his skinny friend. His voice was soft and gentle, in \\ncontrast to his bearing. Kim Ch'omji was indescribably glad to see his \\nfriend. He was as grateful as if Chisam were a benefactor who had saved his \\nlife. \\n\\\"You seem to have had one already, you look in good form yourself today,\\\" \\nKim Ch'omji said, a smile spreading across his face. \\n\\\"I'd have my drink whether I was in good form or not. But what happened \\nto you? You're like a drowned rat. Come on in here and dry yourself.\\\" \\nThe drinking house was warm and comfortable. The clouds of steam \\nrising whitely into the air whenever the lid of the fish pot was lifted; the \\nbeef broiling on the gridiron; dressed meats, liver, soybeans, pollack, lentil \\npancakes ... the disorderly arrangement of side dishes on the table-it all \\nbrought an unbearable burning hunger to Kim Ch'omji's stomach. Ifhe fol\\u00ad\\nlowed his inclinations, he would have gobbled down everything edible there \\nand still not be satisfied. Ravenously hungry, he decided to start with some\\u00ad\\nthing that had a little body to it. He ordered two warm meat pies and a bowl \\nof fish soup. At the taste of food, his famished insides became more and more \\nempty, demanding more and more food. He gulped down a second bowl of \\nsoup, with bean curd and loach, as if it were water. As he set to his third bowl, \\nthe two double portions of makkolli being warmed for them were pro\\u00ad\\nnounced ready. Drinking the rice brew with Chisam, he felt his empty stom\\u00ad\\nach suddenly fill out and a warm glow came to his face. He knocked another \\ndouble straight back. \\nKim Ch'omji's eyes were growing bleary. His cheeks bulged with two \\npieces of rice cake, large pieces cut from the gridiron, and he ordered two \\nmore doubles. Chisam looked at Kim Ch'omji a little dubiously. \\n\\n----- PAGE 14: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\nHYON CHJNGON \\n\\\"More! We've had four each already. That'll come to forty chOn,\\\" he \\nwarned. \\n\\\"What a bloody man! Is forty chon big money? I made a pile today. This \\nwas a real lucky day.\\\" \\n\\\"How much did you make?\\\" \\n\\\"I made thirty won. Thirty won. Why shouldn't I pour this damned liquor \\n... it's all right, it's all right. It doesn't matter how much we drink. I made a \\npile today.\\\" \\n\\\"Ah, you're drunk, you've had enough.\\\" \\n\\\"You think this is enough to make me drunk? Come on, drink up!\\\" he \\ncried, pulling Chisam's ear. Then he turned on the boy who was pouring the \\nmakkolli, a boy of about fourteen with cropped hair. \\n\\\"Pour, you little bastard,\\\" he shouted at the boy. \\nThe boy giggled and looked questioningly at Chisam. \\nThe drunken man read the look and thundered in anger, \\\"You little bas\\u00ad\\ntard, you'd lay your own mother, you think I've no money.\\\" \\nHe fumbled in his waist pocket, took out a one-wan note, and threw it an\\u00ad\\ngrily at the boy. A few silver coins jingled and fell in the process. \\n\\\"Look, you're dropping it. Why are you throwing money all over the \\nplace?\\\" Chisam said, beginning to pick up the money. \\nKim Ch'omji, drunk though he was, opened his eyes wide to see where \\nthe money had gone. He looked down at the :floor, and then as if shocked by \\nthe depravity of what he was doing, he shook his head and gave vent to an \\neven greater anger. \\n\\\"Look here, you dirty sons-of-bitches! You think I've no money. I should \\nbreak every bone in your bodies.\\\" He took the money Chisam had gathered \\nand flung it away. \\\"Blasted money, damn-blasted money,\\\" he cried. The \\ncoins struck the wall and fell into the bowl where the makkolli was being \\nwarmed, emitting a jingling cry as if getting a deserved beating. \\nTwo more doubles were filled and emptied in one motion. Kim Ch'omji \\nlicked the makkolli on his lips and beard. Stroking his pine-needle stub \\nof a beard, he shouted as if greatly pleased with himself, \\\"Another! Keep \\npouring!\\\" \\nAfter yet another double, Kim Ch'omji slapped Chisam on the ~houlder \\nand burst into boisterous laughter, laughter so loud that the eyes of everyone \\nin the establishment were drawn toward him. He laughed all the more. \\n\\\"Look, Chisam, I'll tell you a funny story. I took someone to the station \\ntoday, you see?\\\" \\n\\\"So?\\\" / A LUCKY DAY \\n\\\"Once I was there, I didn't want to come back empty, so I was hanging \\naround the tram-stop wondering how I'd get a fare, and there's a lady, or \\nmaybe a student-it's hard to know a kisaeng from an ordinary girl these \\ndays-standing there in the rain wearing a cape. I ease up beside her, ask her \\ndoes she want a rickshaw and try to take her bag. She brushes away my hand, \\nwheels violently around and shouts 'Why are you pestering people like this?' \\nThere's warbling for you,\\\" Kim Ch'omji cried with a laugh, and he gave a \\nvery good imitation of a warble. Everyone laughed. \\n\\\"Beggarly old bitch, who'd she think she was talking to? Hadn't even dig\\u00ad\\nnity in her moaning.\\\" \\nLaughter swelled all around, but Kim Ch'omji began to snivel before the \\nlaughter faded away. \\nChisam was at a loss. He looked hard at the drunken man. \\n\\\"Laughing and kicking up a racket one minute, crying the next. What \\ndoes it all mean?\\\" \\nKim Ch'omji kept sniveling. \\n\\\"My wife's dead,\\\" he said. \\n\\\"What? Your wife dead? When?\\\" \\n\\\"What do you mean, when? Today of course.\\\" \\n\\\"You're crazy. Don't be telling lies.\\\" \\n\\\"Why would I lie, she's dead, really ... me drinking, she lying there life\\u00ad\\nless ... I deserve to be killed, to be killed.\\\" Kim Ch' omji burst into loud wail\\u00ad\\nmg. \\nChisam's face showed that the pleasant mood had been broken. \\n\\\"I can't tell whether the man is telling the truth or lying. Come on, we'll \\ngo to the house,\\\" he said, pulling the crying man's arm. \\nKim Ch'omji broke away from Chisam's grip and began to laugh sound\\u00ad\\nlessly through tear-filled eyes. \\n\\\"Who says anyone's dead?\\\" he cried, greatly elated. \\\"Why should she be \\ndead? She's as alive as alive can be. Using up good food. I fooled you.\\\" \\nHe clapped his hands and laughed like a child. \\n\\\"I don't know whether you're really out of your mind or not. I mean, I \\nheard your wife was sick,\\\" Chisam said, and as if he felt a certain apprehen\\u00ad\\nsion, he urged Kim Ch'omji to go home again. \\n\\\"She's not dead, I tell you, she's not!\\\" \\nBut there was something in the angry conviction of Kim Chomji's shout \\nthat betrayed an effort on his part to believe she wasn't dead. They had one \\nmore double each, rounding out the one wan, and came away. A nasty rain \\nwas still dripping, dripping down. \\n\\n----- PAGE 15: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n10 HYON CHINGON \\nDrunk though he was, Kim Ch'omji bought some sollongt'ang and arrived \\nhome. Home was a bit of an exaggeration. Actually, it was a rented house\\u00ad\\nnot all of the house, mind you, but a tiny servant's room, separate from the \\nrest of the house, for which he paid one won a month in addition to drawing \\nwater for the main house. Had Kim Ch'omji not been affected by drink, he \\nwould have trembled before the awful silence that dominated the place when \\nhe put his foot on the threshold, like the silence of the sea after a rainstorm \\nhas passed. No racking cough could be heard, no tortured breathing even. \\nOnly one sound broke the gravelike silence, not breaking it really, rather giv\\u00ad\\ning it added depth: the lonely, ominous sound of a child sucking its mother's \\nbreast. Perhaps someone with sensitive hearing might have guessed that the \\nsound was entirely a sucking sound, that there was no gulping sound of milk \\nbeing swallowed, that the child was sucking an empty breast. \\nPerhaps even Kim Ch'omji recognized the ominousness of the silence. If \\nnot, it was rather odd that as soon as he stepped onto the threshold he began \\nto shout, \\\"Damn woman, her husband home and she doesn't come out to \\nmeet him. Goddamn woman!\\\" \\nThe shout was mere bluster to dispel the sinister fear that was suddenly \\nbearing down on him. \\nKim Ch'omji threw the door open. A nauseating stench-the smell of dirt \\nbeneath the reed mat, the smell of stool and urine from unwashed diapers, \\nthe smell of all sorts of dirty clothes, the smell of stale sweat from the in\\u00ad\\nvalid-pierced his drink-blurred nostrils. The drunken man began to yell at \\nthe top of his voice as soon as he entered the room. He didn't even take time \\nto put the sollongt'ang down in the corner. \\n\\\"What a bloody woman! In bed night and day, is that all you want to do? \\nYou can't even get up when your husband comes!\\\" \\nAnd as he shouted he drew a vicious kick at her legs. But it wasn't human \\nflesh he was kicking; it felt like the stump of a tree. The sucking sound \\nchanged to a whimper. The child let go the nipple it had been sucking and \\nbegan to cry. The child's face was all puckered; it was dry crying, no tears \\ncame. Even the whimpering sound seemed to come from the child's belly, \\nnot its lips; crying and crying till no sound could come from its throat, and it \\nseemed not to have the strength to cry again. \\nWhen Kim Ch'omji saw he was getting no results from kicking, he fell on \\nhis wife's head and began to pull and shake her magpie's nest of hair. \\n\\\"Damn woman, say something, talk! Are you dumb, Goddamn woman!\\\" \\nThere was no reaction. \\n\\\"Oh, God, look at her, she won't say a thing.\\\" \\nStill no reaction. A LUCKY DAY 11 \\n\\\"Oh, God, no answer, she really must be dead.\\\" \\nSuddenly he noticed that her eyes were staring straight up with only the \\nwhites showing. \\n\\\"Your eyes, your eyes! Why won't they look straight at me, why are they \\nstaring at the ceiling, why?\\\" he cried. No other sound could come from his \\nthroat. \\nThen the tears of the living spotted and wet the stiff face of the dead like \\nhen's droppings. Kim Ch'omji was like a man gone mad as he rubbed his face \\nagainst the dead woman's. \\n\\\"I brought you some sollongt'ang,'' he muttered. \\\"Why won't you eat it, \\nwhy won't you eat it? ... Unbelievable, today of all days! And my luck was \\nin ...... \\\"\",\n          \"MY INNOCENT UNCLE \\nMy uncle?

It's beyond me how a man like that can ... \\nBrother! \\nHe's got himself a fine row to hoe! \\nSure, he had all those years of schooling, college too, but what's he got to \\nshow for it?

How \\ngenerous of him. \\nNo sooner did he finish his studies and come home than he went nuts over \\nthat damned scotchalism and got himself another woman, one of those \\\"ed\\u00ad\\nucated women,\\\" you know? I've seen her a few times and that puss of hers is \\nnot about to catch anyone's attention. Beats me how a woman who looks like \\nthat can be someone's mistress. They say pretty women are jilted but ugly \\nwomen aren't, and it's a fact that if you stack up my aunt against that woman, \\nthen my aunt is prettier by a long shot. \\nWell, eventually that fine gentleman got nailed by the police and was a \\njailbird for five years. During that time my aunt's family and her in-laws were \\ncompletely ruined and she had no one to depend on. \\nWhat was she supposed to do? It was just a matter of time till she starved. \\nWell, she ended up with me, though she said she didn't much like the idea, \\nbut she needed someone to provide for her, and she had to wait for Uncle's \\nrelease, and I was the only one she had in Seoul. That was-let me see-the \\nyear before Uncle got out. \\nI was just a kid then, but I played all the angles right and soon I had myself \\najob at Mr. Kurada's. \\nI wish I could count all the times I told my aunt she ought to remarry. \\nEven to a young guy like me, it was pitiful and embarrassing to see her like \\nthis. \\nWhile all this was happening a better opportunity came my way. I knew a \\nman named Mr. Mine who sold bananas cheap in front of the Mitsukoshi \\nDepartment Store, and he was a good person all right. My Japanese boss \\nknew him well, too. This Mr. Mine was always telling me he'd like to live \\nwith a \\\"Choson okam,'' and he kept asking me to fix him up. \\nMr. Mine didn't have much in the way of savings, but he was capable of sup\\u00ad\\nporting a family. And so I asked my aunt if she wouldn't be more comfortable MY INNOCENT UNCLE 99 \\nliving with such a person. I asked her more than that, but darned if she didn't \\nturn a deaf ear and tell me to stop coming out with such unseemly talk. \\nThat aside, I've done more than my fair share behind the scenes to take \\ncare of Aunt, right up to the present day, and that's no lie. Besides, I was kind \\nof obligated to her. \\nYou see, when I was seven I lost my parents. I had no place to go, but for\\u00ad\\ntunately my aunt took me in and brought me up. This was after my uncle \\nturned her loose and she went back to live with her parents. \\nBecause back then, at least, they weren't so hard up. My aunt thought I \\nwas the most precious thing, but so did my great-aunt and great-uncle-they \\ndidn't have any other children. \\nI lived there till I was twelve. \\nWent through fourth grade, too. \\nWho knows, maybe if those three hadn't had such sour luck I'd have stuck \\naround and maybe I'd be in college now. \\nI didn't forget that obligation, but I reckon I've paid it off. \\nStill, my aunt comes by from time to time and tells me she's bad off, out of \\nfood. To be honest, I find it kind of aggravating. \\nIf I cave in to her every time, how am I supposed to get on with my life? \\nSo most times I just tell her flat out no. \\nBut there are times, Western New Year for example, when the least I can \\ndo is send her a pound of meat, or else drop by her place for a chat-things \\nlike that. \\nIn any event, for one whole year my aunt worked as a maid for Mr. Ku\\u00ad\\nrada's family and got five won a month. That's not much, but she managed to \\nsave it all, and in her spare time she took in sewing and earned a little money \\non the side, and by the time she left the Kuradas, the mister and missus were \\nimpressed enough with her to give her a seven-wan bonus, and in these vari\\u00ad\\nous ways she put together close to a hundred won. \\nWith that money she took out a small room and bought a few household \\nitems, and then it happened that her dear former hubby-poo was set free and \\nshe took him in. \\nI went with Aunt the day he was let out, and-I can hardly believe this \\nmyself-the moment he came out from his cage the sight of her waiting for \\nhim brought tears to my eyes. \\nAnd that bitch of a mistress he used to dote on-you suppose she showed \\nher mug? Hell, no. What do you expect? They're all like that. \\nMy uncle looked every which way, wondering if the other woman had \\ncome. That's how little sense he has. There was no woman, not even her \\nshadow-just Aunt and me. \\n\\n----- PAGE 60: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n100 CH' AE MANSHIK \\nAs he climbed into the taxi he spit up blood. Seems he started doing that \\nabout a month and a half ago in his cage. \\nAfter the taxi dropped us off we practically had to carry him piggyback the \\nrest of the way home, the guy being half dead and all. But from the moment \\nwe laid him down inside, Aunt looked after him around the clock, and what \\nwith all her bustling and attentiveness he showed a gradual improvement un\\u00ad\\ntil now he's got his life back. What a makeover, I'll tell you-like a toad turn\\u00ad\\ning into a dragon! \\nYou can never underestimate a wife's devotion. \\nAnd that's the way it's been for a good three years now. But if someone had \\nsaid to me, \\\"Be nice to your uncle and I'll bring your parents back to life,\\\" I \\nwould have said, \\\"No thanks!\\\" \\nAnd now, you know what? If that fine gentleman my uncle had any kind of \\na conscience, don't you think he'd say to himself, \\\"Well now, I ought to get \\nmyself back into condition real quick, make me some money fast, make my \\nwife nice and comfortable, and repay her for all she's done for me, to atone \\nfor my sins\\\"? \\nThing is, he won't ever be able to make it up to her, even ifhe carried her \\naround on his back all day long so her feet wouldn't get dirty. \\nIt's time for him to come to his senses. Whatever it takes. And if he can't \\nget a government job or work for a company because of his prison record, \\nwell, he's got no one to blame except himself, so he ought to roll up his \\nsleeves and do some manual labor-that's the least he could do. \\nNow that would be worth seeing-a college graduate doing drudge work. \\nBut what else can he do, you know? \\nAll of which makes me shudder to think what might have happened if my \\ngreat-uncle's family hadn't gone under and I'd graduated from technical \\nschool or college and ended up like my uncle. Good thing I went the way I'm \\ngoing now, without spending all that time studying. \\nFact is, that fine gentleman with all his education, the best he can do \\nnow is day labor. Look at me, though-I barely made it through fourth \\ngrade but my future's bright. Compared with me, he's worse than an errand \\nboy. \\nBut drudge work's the last thing on his mind. Now that he's showing some \\nsigns of life, you wouldn't believe the nonsense that fine gentleman's cooking \\nup. \\nThat damned scotchalism is his worst enemy, and yet he can't give it up. \\nHe's nuts about it. \\nIs it supposed to put food on your table? Is it supposed to make you fa\\u00ad\\nmous? Or maybe in the end it just makes a jailbird out of you. MY INNOCENT UNCLE 101 \\nDamned scotchalism, it's just like opium. Once you get a taste of it you're \\nhooked. \\nBut once you figure out what it really is, it's not very exciting, not much \\nflavor to it. The ones who do it are a bunch of crooks. A bunch of crooks up \\nto no good. \\nNow somewhere in the West, some lazybones who didn't like to work got \\ntogether in a nice sunny place and figured out ways to goof around and still \\nmake a living. My landlord gave me a detailed explanation. \\n\\\"What it is, these rascals get together and debate. One of 'em will say, \\n'Well, in this world there are rich people and poor people, and it's just not \\nfair. Everyone's born with eyes, a nose, a mouth, and a throat, and with two \\narms and two legs, and yet this person is rich and lives well and that person is \\npoor-what kind of nonsense is that? It's only right that the rich ought to \\nshare and share alike with us poor folks.' \\n\\\"And someone else says, 'Yeah, that's the ticket! Yeah, that's telling 'em! \\nShare and share alike.'\\\" \\nHey now, that's a pretty persuasive message. I'll bet it gets a lot of people \\nworked up. \\nWith that kind of nonsense you can see why I think those people are out\\u00ad\\nand-out crooks. \\nSome people get rich because they're born in the right place at the right \\ntime, or else they work hard. And some people are poor because they were \\nborn in the wrong place at the wrong time, or else they're lazy. That's the \\nway things are-the way the world turns. Where do people get off saying it's \\nunfair? Those that figure on stealing what's someone else's are crooks pure \\nand simple. \\nBut it's more than that. If those crooks make good on what they say, then \\nthe lazybones will only get lazier; they'll take what belongs to the rich folks \\nand live off that, and then the world will be full of thieves. Tell me, though\\u00ad\\nwhat happens when the rich people have had everything taken away from \\nthem and there's nothing more to eat? It's doomsday, that's what. \\nIf farmers sit around doing nothing and rob what other farmers have har\\u00ad\\nvested, and if weavers sit around doing nothing and rob what other weavers \\nhave woven, then where's the grain and fabric supposed to come from? The \\nworld's doomed! \\nAnd you know darn well they don't realize that damned scotchalism's \\nsending the world to ruin. Some of those poverty-stricken suckers-the lazy \\nones that don't like to work-got blinded right off the bat by the idea of rob\\u00ad\\nbing what they need from the rich, and then every Yi, Kim, and Pak of 'em \\njoined in. \\n\\n----- PAGE 61: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n102 CH' AE MANSHIK \\nThat's exactly what happened to the Russkies. \\nYou want to know how? Simple: the farmers stopped producing grain and \\ntens of thousands of people are starving to death. Well, any fool could have \\npredicted that. \\nWhat did they expect! That's what happens when people go yippie! think\\u00ad\\ning they got themselves a quick fix. \\nHeck-in no time those worthless practices spread practically around the \\nworld, made waves in the home country too. Then a bunch of Choson guys \\nwho don't know any better got carried away and tried to jump on the band\\u00ad\\nwagon. \\nBut now it's strictly prohibited here, so it's been pretty much reined in and \\nthere's hardly anyone left who's committed to it. \\nAnd I say well done. If it's such a great thing, then tell me, why is it pro\\u00ad\\nhibited here and why do those fellows get pinched and locked up as if they're \\nmortal enemies of the state? \\nIf it's good and beneficial, then of course the government's going to pro\\u00ad\\nmote it. And if you do well at it you'll get an award, right? \\nTake motion pictures; sumo wrestling; comedy shows; Japanese festivals; \\nthe All Souls ceremony; doing calisthenics to the radio, things like that-all \\nof them are beneficial and so they're encouraged by the government, right? \\nWhat's a government for, anyway? Well, it tells us what's good and bad \\nand what's right and wrong, and it directs us to do this or that, and so it tries \\nto help each of us live comfortably according to our lot. \\nNow what would happen if their damned scotchalism wasn't prohibited \\nand they could do whatever they wanted? Can you imagine the state of the \\nworld now? \\nI'll bet a lot of people have gotten screwed over. Good thing it didn't hap\\u00ad\\npen to me. I can just imagine everything getting totally messed up. \\nNow here's my idea. My boss has taken a shine to me, and because he \\ntrusts me it looks like in just ten years or so he'll stake me a considerable \\namount of money and set me up in a different business. Based on that, in just \\nthirty years' time, when I've reached the big six-oh, I'll have put together a \\ngood hundred thousand won from my business. With that much money I'll \\nbe as rich as a thousand-sack-of-rice-a-year man-that's rich even by Choson \\nstandards. I'll be living high on the hog and you better believe it. \\nAnd there's something else my boss said. You see, I'm going to take a \\nyoung lady from the home country for my wife. My boss said he'd take care \\nof everything-he'll pick out a nice, well-behaved one and fix me up with \\nher. Women from the home country sure are swell. \\nMe, I wouldn't take a Choson woman if you gave me one. MY INNOCENT UNCLE 103 \\nThe old-fashioned ones, even though they're well behaved, are ignorant, \\nand people from the home country won't keep company with them. And the \\nmodern ones are all full of themselves just because they've had some school\\u00ad\\ning, so they won't do. So, old-fashioned, modern, doesn't matter-when it \\ncomes to Choson women, forget it! \\nA wife from the home country-that's only for starters. I'll change my \\nname to home-country style, same with house, clothes, food, I'll give my \\nchildren Japanese names and send them to a Japanese school here. \\nJapanese schools, they're the thing. Choson schools are dirty-just per\\u00ad\\nfect for turning out rotten kids. \\nAnd I'm going to kiss the Choson language goodbye and use only the na\\u00ad\\ntional language. \\nBecause once I've taken up home-country manners I'll be able to put to\\u00ad\\ngether a lot of money, just like a home-country man. \\nThat's my plan, and a road's going to open wide to me. At the end of that \\nroad I'll be a two-hundred-thousand-won rich man, and I'm working hard to \\nfollow that road. Heck, is it any wonder I get the creeps from those blood\\u00ad\\nthirsty lunatic scotchalists who are going to be the ruin of the world? It's aw\\u00ad\\nful just to hear about them. \\nWhat do you expect me to do about something that's going to screw up \\nthe world? All my efforts'll go down the drain. And you call that justice? \\nYou know, everything my boss says makes sense. \\nIf you figure that common theft, extortion, or swindling is a form of rob\\u00ad\\nbery, then the only thing you lose is money, so these aren't such serious \\ncrimes. But that damned scotchalism or whatever you call it is going to mess \\nup the world and throw the whole country into chaos-it's simply unforgiv\\u00ad\\nable, he said. \\nForgiveness! If it was me, I'd sweep up the whole lot of' em and show 'em \\nno mercy .... \\nFrankly, when I think about this, that fine gentleman my uncle is a very \\nwicked man. You think I'd visit him if it wasn't for my aunt? No I wouldn't, \\neven if he didn't have that bad disease-I'm no Catholic, you know. And I'm \\nnot about to get choked up when he dies. \\nIt would be one thing if he'd repented for his sins and washed his dirty \\nmind clean, but he'll always be like that-can't expect a tiger to change his \\nstripes. \\nHe really gets my dander up, and the occasional times I drop by, if I \\nhappen to be sitting across from him I'll make a point of attacking him \\nwith spiteful words; I'll pick on something he says and drive him into a \\ncorner. \\n\\n----- PAGE 62: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n104 CH'AE MANSHIK \\nI sure taught him a lesson last time. But get a load of what he told my aunt \\nafterward: that rascal-meaning me-has fallen into bad habits and gone \\ncompletely bad and turned into a good-for-nothing! \\nBrother! To hear that made me speechless! \\nPeople sure are different, but where does he get off saying I've gone bad \\nand turned into a good-for-nothing! You could give that gentleman ten \\nmouths and still he'd come up with something like that! \\nIf I was him I'd wait until all the mutes of Choson could talk before I said \\na word. He must think that what he says actually makes sense! \\nSo that's his excuse for a lecture, huh? I'll bet he :figured that if he told me \\nthat to my face I'd turn the tables on him and give him a hard time, so he de\\u00ad\\ncided to be sly about it and go through my aunt instead. \\nAmazing, isn't it? Good thing God made people's noses with two holes, so \\nwe can snort at stuff like that! \\nSo what if I didn't get nice and educated like him? So what if I bounced \\naround running errands and working as a clerk? I may not look like much, \\nbut I've gotten two commendations for being a model worker, and people \\npraise me to the skies, saying I'm intelligent, skillful, and well mannered. I'm \\na young man with a bright, shining future, and in his eyes I've turned into a \\ngood-for-nothing rascal? \\nYeah,. right! Let me see if I've got this straight. He's saying that since he's \\nright in what he does, then I'm all wrong? \\nAnd so if I was like him and got involved in that damned scotchalism \\nand dropped dead, or became a jailbird and an ex-con and got tuberculosis, \\nthen I could practically say I didn't go bad and didn't turn into a good-for\\u00ad\\nnothing! \\nHuh! The very idea ... \\nThere's a saying that the man who doesn't know his rear end stinks blames \\nothers, and guess which fine gentleman that seems to fit? \\nAnd in fact that's how it was the day I taught him a lesson and then he said \\nthose things to my aunt. \\nIt happened to be my day off, and I had something to talk about with my \\naunt, so I dropped by, but my aunt had left to do some sewing for a wedding. \\nThat fine gentleman my uncle was the only one home, and as usual he had \\nfound his way to the warm spot on the heated floor to lie down. \\nI found him thumbing through a big stack of Korean-language magazines \\nhe dug up from God knows where. \\nWell, just for fun I picked up one myself and started poking through it, \\nbut it was pretty dull stuff. \\nFor the life of me I wish I knew why every magazine that Choson people \\nput out is like that one. No pictures, no comics. And they've all got those MY INNOCENT UNCLE 105 \\ncomplicated Chinese characters stuck in there-who are they supposed to be \\nfor anyway? Plus, for guys like us, even when you wade through the Korean \\nin there, it's god-awful difficult to understand. \\nSo when they combine difficult Korean with complicated Chinese, you \\ncan't make out the meaning and so you don't read it. There are these stupid \\nstories written in Korean; they're hard to read, and what's more, stories writ\\u00ad\\nten by Choson people put me to sleep. Me, I gave up on Choson newspapers \\nand magazines a long time ago. \\nAs far as magazines are concerned, you can't beat King and Shonen Club. \\nThey're top-notch! Every time there's a Chinese character it has kana tacked \\non to it, and wherever you open it up you can cruise right through it and \\nknow clearly what's going on. \\nAnd wherever you read, there's something to learn from it or else an in\\u00ad\\nteresting story. \\nThe stories sure are fun! Especially the ones by Kan Kikuchi ... nice en\\u00ad\\ntertainment, and they've got feeling too! And those swashbuckling epics by \\nYoshikawa Eiji-I just can't sit still when I read them. \\nThe stories are all fun like that, there's a lot of comics, lots of photos too, \\nand considering all that, the price is on the cheap side. You can get last \\nmonth's issue for I 5 chon, and after you read it you can sell it back for 5 ch'On. \\nAs long as you're going to make a magazine, that's how it ought to be, but \\nfor all their bullshit Choson people haven't come up with one presentable \\nmagazine yet! \\nBut heck, I wasn't going to find anything nifty to read in that crummy \\nmagazine, so I tried to find some comics or photos, and what do you know, I \\ncame across an article with my uncle's name on it! I was amazed, and I held it \\nup to take a look. The title had something to do with economy and the char\\u00ad\\nacters it was written in were as big as cows' eyes. Next to it was a smaller line \\nthat included the word society. \\nI knew what was what just from seeing that much. Economy was what my \\nuncle had studied in college, so he knew about that, and society, well, he was \\ninvolved with scotchalism, so he knew about society too. So it was obvious he \\nwas writing about how economy and scotchalism were related, and which \\nside he was on, and which side was right-stuff like that. \\nI didn't have to read that article to figure it out. I mean, this fine gentleman \\nwent to college and studied economy and wasn't interested in making money \\nso he got mixed up with scotchalism, and so he probably swears up and down \\nthe whole article through that economy is wrong and scotchalism is right. \\nAnyway, I was impressed to see he'd actually written something, so I fig\\u00ad\\nured I'd give it a try. But when I glanced through it-no way did I have the \\nbrains for it. \\n\\n----- PAGE 63: Modern_Korean_fiction___an_anthology_--_Edited_by_Bruce_Fulton_and_Youngmin_Kwon_--_New_York,_New_York_State,_2005_--_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY_PRESS_NEW_--_9780231135122_--_dd5793ac4fd1dff21dc5e0eb171b823f_--_Anna\\u2019s_Archive.pdf -----\\n106 CH' AE MANSHIK \\nI could have gotten a rough idea if the words weren't so hard, but when I \\npieced together what I could, not for the life of me could I figure out what he \\nwas trying to say. \\nI was kind of irritated so I said to myself, ah, the hell with this, and instead \\nI decided to corner him and give him a hard time, and I spread out the article \\nin front of him. \\n\\\"Uncle?\\\" \\n\\\"What is it?\\\" \\n\\\"You're writing something here about economy and society-are you \\ntelling people to do economy, or are you telling them to do scotchalism?\\\" \\n\\\"What?\\\" \\nHe didn't understand.

So I tried to be a little \\nmore precise. \\n\\\"Uncle-doesn't economy mean making money and getting rich? And \\ndoesn't scotchalism mean taking money that rich folks have saved up and \\nspending it yourself?\\\" \\n\\\"What are you trying to say, boy!\\\" \\n\\\"Hold on and please listen to me.\\\" \\n\\\"Where did you come up with the notion that economics and socialism \\nare like that?\\\" \\n\\\"It's common sense: doesn't economy mean making a lot of money, spend\\u00ad\\ning just a little, and saving the rest?\\\" \\n\\\"That's usually what people mean by economizing, and that's different from \\nthe study of economics and the word economic.\\\" \\n\\\"Difference? I don't get it. If economy is all about making money, then \\neconomics must be the study of how to make money.\\\" \\n\\\"No. There's something called finance, and I guess you could think of it as \\nthe study of making money, but that's not what economics is about.\\\" \\n\\\"Well, if that's the case, then you made a mistake going to college. You \\nspent five or six years studying economics that didn't teach you how to econ\\u00ad\\nomize-what's the use?

Well, well, maybe so. You're right, yes, you are!\\\" \\nDoggone, I got him now! I said to myself. So what if he went to college and \\nknows all sons of obscure stuff? See, didn't I tell you-doggone! \\n\\\"Uncle?\\\" \\n\\\"What is it now?\\\" MY INNOCENT UNCLE 107 \\n\\\"You mean you went to college and studied scotchalism, not economy? \\nYou studied how to take money from rich people and spend it, instead of \\nmaking it yourself?\\\" \\n\\\"What do you know about socialism, talking like that?\\\" \\n\\\"Well, I know something about that stuff.\\\" \\nAnd I proceeded to give it to him straight. \\nHe looks right into my face from where he's lying and gives me a little \\nsmirk. And then listen to what this fine gentleman had to say. \\n\\\"So that's socialism, eh? Well, I'd call it thuggery.\\\" \\n\\\"Well now, so you know scotchalism is thuggery too.\\\" \\n\\\"I didn't say that.\\\" \\n\\\"Did too! Just now.\\\" \\n\\\"What you're talking about is thuggery, not socialism.\\\" \\n\\\"There you go!

If you \\nkeep planning and finding opportunities, there's nothing in this world you \\ncan't do as long as you fight for it.
